In December retail  sales rose sharply, but the increase in the fourth quarter as a whole was less than that in the third quarter. After having slowed over the preceding 2 months, the rise in industrial production and in non farm payroll employment accelerated in December. However, the unemployment rate remained at 8.3 per cent, as the civilian labor force grew about as much as total employment. The increase in average wholesale prices of industrial commodities was again relatively large, but average prices of farm products and foods declined sharply further. The index of average wage rates was unchanged in December, following 2 months of large increases.  The exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies held steady in December but eased somewhat in early January. Another sizable foreign trade surplus was registered in November.  M1 declined in December, and growth in M2 and M3 slowed considerably. At commercial banks, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's slowed, despite a continuing build-up of business  savings accounts, while inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions were relatively well maintained. In terms of quarterly averages, growth in M1 from the third to the fourth quarter was modest, while growth in M2 and M3 was more substantial. In recent weeks interest rates on both short- and long-term securities have declined appreciably. In mid-January Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 6 to 5-1/2 per cent.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the  period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.",197601,0,106,1976-01-31,0.72,0.95,0.12,0.44,2.23,1.23,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1976-01-20

In January retail sales remained at an advanced level and recovery  in industrial production continued. Gains in nonfarm employment were large and widespread and the unemployment rate dropped from 8.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent. Average whole sale prices of industrial commodities increased somewhat less than in the preceding 2 months, and average prices  of farm products and foods declined appreciably further. The index of average wage rates advanced substantially in January, but a significant part of the rise reflected an increase in the minimum wage on the first of the month.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar has changed little over the past 4 weeks. There have been disturbances in foreign exchange markets affecting primarily European currencies, and rates for several currencies have moved considerably. In December the foreign trade surplus was substantial, although not as large as in other recent months, and bank-reported private capital movements shifted to a net outflow.  M1, which had declined in December, increased only a little in January, but M2 and M3 rose considerably. At commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's expanded substantially. Inflows into savings accounts were especially large in January, as short-term market interest rates continued to decline early in the month and fell below Regulation Q ceiling rates on such accounts. In recent weeks, interest rates on both short- and long-term securities have changed little, while mortgage interest rates have declined somewhat.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.

In February retail sales rose considerably and recovery in industrial production continued. Gains in non farm employment were again wide spread and the unemployment rate dropped from 7.8 to 7.6 per cent. Wholesale prices of all commodities declined again in February, as average prices of .farm products and foods fell appreciably further. Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities increased somewhat less than in January, owing in part to a reduction in crude oil prices required by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Over recent months, the  advance in the index of average wage rates has moderated somewhat.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has increased in recent weeks to its highest level in 2 years. In the exchange markets, the British pound has depreciated sharply; the lira has weakened further; and most recently, the French franc has depreciated after abandonment of efforts to maintain fixed margins with certain other Euro pean currencies. In January the U.S. foreign trade balance shifted into deficit.  M1 , which had increased only a little in January, expanded moderately in February; M2 and M3 rose sharply. At commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's remained large. Since mid-February, both short- and long-term interest rates have changed little on balance.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial  conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic financial markets and the sensitive state of foreign exchange markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.  By unanimous vote, the Committee removed the 1-year time limitation it had attached on March 18, 1975, to an increase from $1 billion to $2 billion in the dollar limit, specified in paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, on System holdings of special short-term certificates of indebtedness purchased directly from the Treasury.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained  in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to annual review.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of review ing such matters at the first meeting in March of every year.",197603,0,108,1976-03-31,0.02,0.36,0.04,0.17,0.59,1.39,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1976-03-16

In March retail sales rose sharply further and recovery in industrial production continued. Gains in non-farm employment were again widespread and the unemployment rate declined from 7.6 to 7.5 per cent. Over the first quarter wholesale prices of farm products, foods, and fuels declined appreciably, but average wholesale prices of other commodities rose almost as rapidly as during the second half of 1975.  Over recent months, the advance in the index of average wage rates has moderated somewhat.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has been relatively steady in recent weeks, while the British pound and the Italian lira have remained under considerable downward pressure. In February the U.S. foreign trade balance registered a second successive monthly deficit; reported net out flows of private capital remained moderate.

In April recovery in industrial production continued, and gains in employment were large and widespread. However, the civilian labor force also increased substantially, and the unemployment rate continued at 7.5 per cent. Retail sales remained at the March level. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose appreciably in April, reflecting a sharp increase in average prices of farm products and foods and a modest increase in prices of industrial commodities. Over recent months, the index of average wage rates has advanced moderately.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has been relatively steady in recent weeks. During the first quarter, there was a sizable U.S. foreign trade deficit, in contrast to the large surpluses in the preceding four quarters.  M1, which had expanded moderately in February and March, increased sharply in April, reflecting in part a drop in U.S. Government deposits. Inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's were  strong at banks and nonbank thrift institutions, and M2 and M3 increased substantially. In recent weeks, both short- and long-term market interest rates have risen.

In May retail sales declined from the March-April level and were near the monthly average of the first quarter. However, recovery in industrial production continued at about the average pace of the first 4 months of the year, and the gain in employment again was substantial. The unemployment rate declined from 7.5 to 7.3 per cent. The rise in the wholesale price index for all commodities, which had been large in April, was moderate in May; average prices of farm products and foods rose much less than in April. Average prices of industrial commodities changed little in May, but in recent weeks price increases have been announced for some major industrial materials. The rise in con sumer prices in May was somewhat faster than the average increase in earlier months of the year, owing to increases in prices of food and energy items. The advance in the index of average wage rates was larger in May than the gains in other recent months, owing in part to implementation of a new labor contract in a major industry.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has been relatively steady in recent weeks. On June 7 a total of $5.3 billion of 6-month stand-by credits to the United Kingdom was announced, including $1 billion under the Federal Reserve System's swap line and $1 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Subsequently, the decline in the pound sterling was halted and partly reversed. In April the U. S. foreign trade deficit was at the same rate as in the first quarter.  Growth in monetary aggregates slowed substantially in May and early June from the exceptionally rapid rates recorded in April, mainly because of a sharp slackening in expansion of demand deposits at commercial banks; inflows of those time and savings deposits included in the broader aggregates were relatively well maintained.  Market interest rates in general rose somewhat further in the latter part of May, but since then, short-term rates have fluctuated in a narrow range and long-term rates have edged down.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

In June growth in industrial production slowed and nonfarm payroll employment changed little.  The unemployment rate edged up to 7.5 per cent from 7.3 per cent in May, but this increase may have partly reflected seasonal adjustment problems. Retail sales rebounded strongly in June. The rise in the wholesale price index for all commodities remained moderate, as the advance in average prices of farm products and foods slowed further. However, average prices of industrial commodities rose more than in other recent months. The advance in.the index of average wage rates slowed considerably in June following a sharp rise in May; over the second quarter as a whole the index rose at about the same rate as in the first quarter.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained relatively steady in recent weeks. In May there was a small surplus in the U.S. foreign trade balance.  M1, which had grown moderately in May, declined slightly in June. From the first to the second quarter, however, M1 expanded at an 8.4 per cent annual rate because of the exceptional rise in April. Growth in M2 and M3 moderated in June, mainly because of the decline in M1, although inflows of the time and savings deposits included in the broader aggregates also slowed somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have declined somewhat in recent weeks, and most long-term rates have edged down.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.",197607,0,112,1976-07-31,0.31,0.17,0.02,0.03,0.53,0.33,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1976-07-20

In August industrial production continued to expand at about the average rate in the preceding 4 months. Retail sales apparently rose vigorously, after having changed little on balance since April. Payroll employment in nonfarm establishments rose appreciably further, but according to household survey data, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.8 to 7.9 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities was about unchanged in August, as a substantial decline in average prices of farm products and foods offset another large increase in average prices of industrial commodities. So far this year the advance in the index of average wage rates has been somewhat below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained relatively steady in recent weeks, declining somewhat against most of these currencies but rising against the pound sterling. The Mexican peso was allowed to depreciate on September 1 and in recent days has been about 37 per cent below its old value against the dollar. In July the U.S. foreign trade deficit increased sharply.  M1 and M2 grew at moderate rates in August. Inflows of the time and savings deposits included in M2 were relatively strong, although they slackened from the high rate in July. Inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift  institutions accelerated, however, and growth in M3 remained rapid. Most market interest rates have declined somewhat further in recent weeks.

In September retail sales changed little, following a sizable increase in August. Industrial production was unchanged in September; in the latter half of the month output of automobiles and trucks was curtailed by a strike at plants of a major producer. Payroll employment in nonfarm establishments rose further; according to household survey data, the unemployment rate edged down from 7.9 to 7.8 per cent, as total employment and the civilian labor force both declined. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose sharply in September; average prices of farm products and foods increased, after 2 months of substantial declines, and average prices of industrial commodities rose somewhat more than in other recent months. The advance in the index of average wage rates has remained somewhat below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained relatively steady in recent weeks, declining somewhat against the German mark and associated European currencies but rising against the pound sterling and the French franc. On October 18 the mark was revalued by an average of 3 per cent against the associated European currencies. In August  the U. S. foreign trade deficit remained larger than the monthly average in the second quarter; over all, the current account had been in surplus in the second quarter.  M1 was about unchanged in September. However, M2 and M3 grew substantially, as inflows of the time and savings deposits included in these broader aggregates were exceptionally strong. Market interest rates generally have declined further in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.",197610,0,115,1976-10-31,-0.02,-0.2,0.06,-0.29,-0.45,0.17,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1976-10-19

In October retail sales increased little following a decrease in September. Industrial production and employment in manufacturing declined, in part because of strikes. After adjustment for strikes, total payroll employment in nonfarm establishments rose somewhat further. According to household survey data, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.8 to 7.9 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose less rapidly in October than in September as average prices of farm products and foods declined; however, average prices of industrial commodities rose sharply further. The advance in the index of average wage rates over recent months has remained somewhat below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained steady in recent weeks, declining slightly against the German mark and associated European currencies but rising against the pound sterling and the lira. In September the U. S. foreign trade deficit widened again, and the third-quarter deficit was about double the average of the first two quarters of 1976.  M1, which was about unchanged in September, expanded sharply in October. Growth in M2 and M3 accelerated as inflows of the time and savings deposits included in these broader aggregates continued exceptionally strong. Interest rates have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent weeks.

In both October and November retail sales increased substantially. Industrial production rose appreciably in November--following 2 months of decline--in large part as a result of termination of strikes in two major industries, although advances in output were widespread among other industries. Employment in manufacturing also recovered from the effects of strikes. According to household survey data, the gain in total employment was large, but the unemployment rate increased from 7.9 to 8.1 per cent as the civilian labor force--which had changed little over the preceding 3 months--increased considerably. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose as much in November as in October, reflecting another substantial increase in average prices of industrial commodities; average prices of farm products and foods changed little. The advance in the index of average wage rates over recent months has remained below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined slightly in recent weeks. The pound sterling and also the currencies associated in the European ""snake"" arrangement strengthened against the U. S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar depreciated sharply. In October the U. S. foreign trade deficit remained substantial.  M-1, which had expanded sharply in October, was unchanged in November. Although growth in M-2 and M-3 moderated, it remained substantial as inflows of the time and savings deposits included in these broader aggregates continued strong. Interest rates have declined appreciably in recent weeks. In late November Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 5-1/2 to 5-1/4 per cent, and in mid-December member bank reserve requirements were lowered somewhat.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.",197612,0,117,1976-12-31,0.48,0.31,0.23,0.45,1.46,0.81,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1976-12-21

In December retail sales increased sharply, following strong gains in the preceding 2 months. Industrial production and total employment rose further, and the unemployment rate declined from 8.1 to 7.9 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose substantially, reflecting a sharp increase in average prices of farm products and foods; the rise in average prices of industrial commodities slowed, owing largely to declines in prices of fuels. The advance in the index of average wage rates over recent months has remained below the  rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies declined in December but has since recovered somewhat. The pound sterling strengthened following negotiation of an IMF stand-by arrangement and of a medium term facility to offset reductions in official  sterling balances. In November the U. S. foreign trade deficit increased, bringing the October-November average deficit to about the  third-quarter rate.  M-1, which was unchanged in November, expanded appreciably in December; from the third to the fourth quarter growth in M-1 was moderate. Inflows of the time and savings deposits included in M-2 and M-3 were almost as large in December as in November, and growth in these broader aggregates was substantial. Interest rates changed little in late December but recently have moved up.

Housing starts rose sharply in December, and labor market surveys completed by mid-January indicated a further rise in employment and a decline in the unemployment rate from 7.8 to 7.3 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities continued to rise, reflecting increases in the average both for farm products and foods and for industrial commodities. The index of average wage rates rose sharply in January as a result of marked increases in the volatile construction and service sectors.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen somewhat over the past month. In December the U. S. foreign trade deficit increased further; in the fourth quarter as a whole the deficit was a little larger than in the third quarter.  M-1, which had expanded appreciably in December, grew at a moderate pace in January. Growth in M-2 and M-3 also moderated. At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's slowed somewhat. Interest rates have changed relatively little on balance since mid-January.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on January 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 10 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the pre ceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the February March period to be within the ranges of 3 to 7 per cent for M-1 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates  are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 4-1/4 to 5 per cent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  By unanimous vote,the Committee revised No. 4 of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues to read as follows, effective immediately;  4.

In February industrial output and retail sales expanded substantially after being held down for a time by the effects of unusually severe weather. Employment rose  considerably further; the unemployment rate increased somewhat to 7.5 per cent--as the labor force more than recovered the decline  of January--but it remained below the 7.8 per cent of December. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose substantially in February, reflecting large increases for farm products and foods and for fuels and power. The index of average wage rates rose more moderately over the first 2 months of 1977 than it had on the average during 1976.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has changed little over the past month. In January the U. S. foreign trade deficit increased further;  exports were down a little from the fourth quarter rate and imports were substantially higher.  Growth in M-1 slowed sharply in February from the moderate pace in January. At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large denomination CD's continued to slacken. Business demands for short-term credit appear to have strengthened further in early 1977. Since mid-Februay short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance, but most longer-term rates have edged higher.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions.  At its meeting on January 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 10 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977 appears to be consistent with these objectives.  These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within the ranges of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent for M-1 and 7 to 11 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over  the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  per cent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first meeting in March of every year.",197703,0,120,1977-03-31,0.6,0.82,0.11,0.27,1.79,1.12,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1977-03-15

In March industrial output, retail sales, and employment expanded substantially further. Although the labor force also increased sharply, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5 to 7.3 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities again rose substantially; increases were particularly sharp among farm products and foods, and there were sizable advances for many industrial commodities. The index of average wage rates rose in the first quarter of 1977 at a somewhat faster pace than it had on the average during 1976, reflecting largely an increase in the minimum wage.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined some what over the past month, returning to about  the level at the beginning of the year. Demand for the Japanese yen and the U.K. pound intensified. The U. S. foreign trade  deficit continued large in February.  M-1 grew at a moderate pace in March but increased substantially in early April. At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large denomination CD's continued to slacken in March. Market interest rates declined considerably in mid-April, after having changed little since mid-March.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions.  Growth in M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 9-1/2 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11 per cent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1977 to the first quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives.

The rates of believed Committee seeks to encourage near-term growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path to be reasonably consistent with the  longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.

In April industrial output and employment continued to expand at a substantial pace, and the unemployment rate declined from 7.3 to 7.0 per cent. Total retail sales remained at the advanced level reached in March. The wholesale price  index for all commodities rose substantially in April for the third consecutive month; increases  again were particularly sharp among farm products and foods, and they remained sizable for industrial commodities.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has changed little on balance over the past month. The U. S. foreign trade deficit widened further in March; for the first quarter as a whole, the deficit was twice as large as for the preceding quarter,.  The increase in M-1, which had been moderate in the first quarter, was exceptionally large in April. Inflows of the time and savings deposits  included in the broader aggregates were slower than earlier in the year, but because of the rapid  expansion in M-1, growth in M-2 and M-3 accelerated. Business short-term borrowing expanded sharply while corporate financing in the capital markets was reduced. Market interest rates have risen in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of inter national transactions.  At its meeting on April 19, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 9-1/2 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11 per cent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1977 to the first quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the pre ceding paragraph.

In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 5-3/8 per cent.

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services has grown in the current quarter at about the rapid rate of the first quarter. In May industrial output and employment continued to expand at a substantial pace, and the unemployment rate edged down from 7.0 to 6.9 per cent. Total retail sales increased from the advanced March-April level. The rise in the wholesale price index for all commodities slowed substantially in May, as average prices of farm products and foods changed little after having increased sharply for three consecutive months; average prices of industrial commodities also rose less than in other recent months.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has changed little on balance over the past month. The U. S. foreign trade deficit was nearly as large in April as in March.  M-1 increased only slightly in May, after rising at an exceptionally rapid rate in April. Reflecting mainly the behavior of M-1, growth in M-2 and M-3 also slowed sharply. Inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's continued to slacken, but inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained sizable. Business short-term borrowing moderated from the sharply increased pace of April, and corporate borrowing in the capital markets was reduced further. Short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance in recent weeks, while longer-term yields have declined.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on April 19, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 9-1/2 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11 per cent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1977 to the first quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about 5-3/8 per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the June July period at annual rates within ranges of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent and 6 to 10 per cent, respectively.

In June industrial output continued to expand at a substantial pace, The rise in employment moderated, and the unemployment rate edged up from 6.9 to 7.1 per cent. Total retail sales remained at about the level reached in March; for the second quarter as a whole, however, sales were moderately above the first-quarter level. The wholesale price index for all commodities declined in June, owing to sharp decreases among farm products and foods; as in May, average prices of industrial commodities rose appreciably less than in earlier months of 1977. The index of average hourly earnings rose over the first half of the year at about the same pace that it had on the average during 1976,  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined more than 1 per cent over the past month; the declines were especially marked against the Japanese, German, and Swiss currencies. In May the U. S. foreign trade deficit diminished somewhat from the high  rate in the first 4 months of the year.  M-1, after rising at an exceptionally rapid rate in April, increased little in May and grew at a moderate pace in June. Growth in M-2 and M-3 also was moderate in June. Inflows to banks of the time and savings deposits included in M-2 picked up somewhat, after having slackened for a number of months, and inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained sizable. Business short-term borrowing expanded sharply in June. Market interest rates in general have changed little in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions  that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of inter national transactions.  Growth in M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 9-1/2 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11 per cent, respectively, from the second quarter of 1977 to the second quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the pre ceding paragraph. Specifically, at present,,it expects the annual growth rates over the July August period to be within the ranges of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 per cent for M-1 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 5-3/8 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 per cent.

In July industrial output rose a little less than in June. The rise in payroll employment in non farm establishments was substantial. According to the household survey data, total nonagricultural employment was unchanged and the unemployment rate edged down to 6.9 per cent, the same as in May. The dollar value of total retail sales rose somewhat, after 2 months of  decline. The wholesale price index for all commodities was about unchanged in July; average prices of farm products and foods declined sharply further, and average prices of industrial commodities continued to rise at a more moderate pace than in the early months of 1977.  The index of average hourly earnings has continued to advance at about the same pace that it had on the average during 1976.  The weighted average exchange rate for the dollar  against leading foreign currencies has recovered more  than 1 per cent from the low point reached in late July. In June the U.S. foreign trade deficit rose sharply, and the deficit was larger for the second quarter as a whole than for the first.  The increase in M-1 was exceptionally large in July. Inflows to banks of the time and savings deposits included in the broader monetary aggregates strengthened, and growth in M-2 and M-3 also accelerated sharply. Busi ness short-term borrowing moderated from the rapid pace in June. Interest rates on short- and intermediate-term market instruments have risen appreciably in recent weeks, while yields on longer-term bonds have changed little.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustain able pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on July 19, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 9-1/2 per.cent, and 8-1/2 to 11 per cent, respectively, from the second quarter of 1977 to the second quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates .over the August-September period to be within the ranges of 0 to 5 percent for M-1 and 3 to 8 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 6 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 per cent.

Lilly, Morris, Roos, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed,  until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic  policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services has grown less rapidly in the current quarter than in the second quarter. In August industrial output declined by about as much as it had risen in July. Employment increased moderately but the labor force rose more and the unemployment rate edged up to 7.1 per cent, the same as in June. The dollar value of total retail sales, which had turned up in July, rose appreciably in August. The wholesale price index for all commodities was about unchanged; average prices of farm products and foods declined sharply for the third successive month, and average prices of industrial commodities continued to rise at a more moderate pace than in the early months of 1977. So far this year the index of average hourly earnings has advanced at about the same pace as it had on the average during 1976.  The weighted average exchange rate for the dollar against leading foreign currencies has recovered further in recent weeks, returning to the level of late June. In July the U. S. foreign trade deficit was at about the second-quarter rate, and there were sizable net inflows of foreign private and official capital.  Growth in M-1 and M-2 slowed in August from the exceptionally rapid rates in July. Expansion of both demand deposits and time and savings deposits at banks slackened. Growth in M-3 also slowed, although inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained strong. Business short-term borrowing increased somewhat from the reduced pace in July, but remained below the volume of preceding months. Short-term interest rates, which had risen appreciably in early August, most recently have advanced somewhat further. Yields on longer-term market securities, however, have changed little on balance in recent months. Federal Reserve discount rates were increased from 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 per cent in late August and early September, and member bank borrowings receded from the high levels of the latter part of August.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of inter national transactions.  At its meeting on July 19, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 9-1/2 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11 per cent, respectively, from the second quarter of 1977 to the second quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the pre ceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the September October period to be within the ranges of 2 to 7 percent for M-1 and 4 to 8 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 6-1/4 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid points of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range  of 6 to 6-1/2 per cent.

In September industrial production expanded, returning to about the level reached in July, and employment increased substantially. The unemployment rate edged down to 6.9 per cent, but remained near the level prevailing since April. The dollar value of total retail sales declined after having risen appreciably in July and August. The wholesale price index for all commodities, which had declined on balance since May, advanced in September; average prices of farm products and foods changed little following 3 months of sharp decreases, and average prices of industrial commodities rose  more than in the immediately preceding months. So far this year the index of average hourly earnings has advanced at about the same pace as it had on the average during 1976.  Pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets emerged at the end of September, and the dollar has declined against most major foreign currencies and particularly against the Japanese yen. In August the U.S. foreign trade deficit widened; the July-August average was somewhat above the second-quarter rate.  M-1 and M-2 expanded somewhat more in September than in August, and increased substantially further in early October. Inflows to banks of time and savings deposits increased little in September from the reduced rate in August, while inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained strong. Short-term interest rates have risen further in recent weeks, and yields on longer-term market securities have increased.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 8 to 10-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about 6-1/2 per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing  over the October-November period at annual rates within ranges of 3 to 8 per cent and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent, respectively.

The dollar value of total retail sales, which had been unchanged in September, rose substantially in October. Industrial production and employment increased somewhat. The unemployment rate, at 7.0 per cent, remained in the narrow range prevailing since April. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose sharply in October, as average prices of farm products and foods increased after having declined appreciably over the preceding 4 months. Prices of industrial commodities rose at about the average rate of the preceding 12 months. The index of average hourly earnings increased sharply in September and has advanced at a some what faster pace so far this year than it had on the average during 1976.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further since mid-October. In September the U. S. foreign trade deficit was reduced somewhat, in part as a result of temporary factors.  M-1 and M-2 increased substantially in October, but growth slowed sharply in early November. In October inflows to banks of the total of savings deposits and small-denomination time deposits fell off, but banks expanded the outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's substantially as credit demands strengthened.  Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat in October from the strong pace of the preceding 2 months. Following a substantial rise in member bank borrowings, Federal Reserve discount rates were increased from 5-3/4 to 6 per cent in late October. Market interest rates have fluctuated moderately since mid-October and most recently have tended to decline.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions.  At its meeting on October 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 8 to 10-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the current level, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the November-December period at annual rates within ranges of 1 to 7 per cent and 5 to 9 per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 per cent.

The dollar value of total retail sales, which had increased sharply in October, rose considerably further in November. Industrial production continued to expand, and employment increased substantially.  However, the unemployment rate, at 6.9 per cent, remained in the narrow range prevailing since April. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose sharply in November for the second successive month, reflecting another large increase in average prices of farm products and foods. However, the rise in average prices of industrial commodities was less rapid than in the preceding 2 months. The index of average hourly earnings has advanced at a somewhat faster pace so far this year than it had on the average during 1976.  The dollar has been under considerable pressure in foreign exchange markets in recent weeks, and its trade-weighted value against major foreign currencies has declined more than  3 per cent further since mid-November. In October the U. S. foreign trade deficit widened sharply, primarily as a result of the dock strike at many U. S. ports.  M-1--which had expanded substantially in October--declined slightly in November, and M-2 increased relatively little. The total of savings deposits and small-denomination time deposits at commercial banks declined somewhat, but growth in large-denomination time deposits accelerated sharply further as credit demands remained strong. Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed further in November. Market interest rates have changed relatively little since mid-November.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic  expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on October 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M- 2 ; and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2  to 9 per cent, and 8 to 10-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives.

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2 month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 per cent.

The dollar value of total retail sales declined in December, but the gain from the third to the fourth quarter was substantial. Industrial production expanded somewhat further in December, although the rise was limited by a strike in coal mining. Employment increased appreciably, and the unemployment rate declined from 6.7 per cent to 6.4 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose considerably less in December than in the preceding 2 months, reflecting a much smaller increase in average prices of farm products and foods. Prices of industrial commodities advanced at about the average pace in the preceding 2 months. The index of average hourly earnings advanced slightly faster during 1977 than it had during 1976.  Exchange market pressure on the dollar has continued in recent weeks. On January 4 it was announced that the Exchange Stabilization Fund would be utilized actively together with the swap network operated by the Federal Reserve System to help reestablish order in the foreign exchange markets. On January 6 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 6 to 6-1/2 per cent was announced. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined about 2-1/2 per cent further from mid-December to the early days of January but subsequently recovered about 1-3/4 per cent.  M-1--which had declined slightly in November--rose in December. Growth in M-2 remained relatively slow, as inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's were sharply curtailed. Inflows to non bank thrift institutions slowed somewhat further. Market interest rates edged up in late December, and rates- particularly for short-term securities--rose substantially further in the early weeks of January.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on October 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 8 to 10-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter  of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives.

It appears, however, that there  has been little change in the underlying economic situation. Employment increased further in January and the unemployment rate edged down from 6.4 to 6.3 per cent. Both the consumer price index and the wholesale price index rose substantially. The index of average hourly earnings advanced sharply, as higher minimum wages became effective at the beginning of the year.  After a period of calm, the dollar came under renewed downward pressure around mid February, and its trade-weighted value against major foreign currencies has declined about 1-1/2 per cent. The Swiss franc and the German mark have registered the most pronounced appreciations against the dollar.  M-1 expanded appreciably in January but declined somewhat in early February. Growth in M-2 picked up in January, reflecting some  strengthening in inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's. Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions continued to slow. Market interest rates have changed little in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth of M-l, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1977 to the fourth quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives.

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to  maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the current level, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the February March period at annual rates within ranges of 1 to 6 per cent and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/2 to 7 per cent.

In February industrial production recovered much of the decline of the preceding month, and nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably further. The unemployment rate declined from 6.3 to 6.1 per cent. Retail sales picked up somewhat from the sharply reduced level of January. The pace of the rise in prices stepped up in February, reflecting large increases in farm products and processed foods. The index of average hourly earnings was unchanged, after having advanced sharply in January when higher minimum wages became effective.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose sharply in anticipation of the U.S.- German announcements on March 13. Subsequently, the dollar declined to about the level at the end of February. The U. S. trade statistics reported for January showed a continuing large deficit.  M-1 declined and M-2 increased relatively little in February, apparently in part because of the economic effects of the coal strike and  the severe weather. Inflows to banks of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 were about maintained, but the inflows were almost entirely into large-denomination time deposits exempt from ceilings on interest rates. In flows to nonbank thrift institutions remained slow. Market interest rates have changed little in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on February 28, 1978, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1977 to the fourth quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within ranges of 4 to 8 per cent for M-1 and 5-1/2 to 9 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 6-3/4 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/2 to 7 per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange markets.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

In March industrial production and non farm payroll employment increased sharply further. The unemployment rate edged up from 6.1 to 6.2 per cent, as the civilian labor force expanded substantially. Retail sales recovered much more in February than had been reported earlier, and sales rose considerably further in March.  The pace of the rise in wholesale prices remained rapid, reflecting further large increases in farm products and processed foods. The index of average hourly earnings accelerated in the first quarter, largely because of the increase in minimum wages at the beginning of the year.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply after the March 31  announcement of a very large increase in the U. S. foreign trade deficit for February. But over the past week the dollar has recovered to about its level of 4 weeks ago.  M-1, which had declined in February, rose moderately in March. Inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's and inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained slow. Most market interest rates, especially longer-term rates, have increased somewhat on balance in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 appears to be consistent with these objectives. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.

The pace of the rise in wholesale prices remained rapid, reflecting mainly further large increases in farm products and processed foods. The index of average hourly earnings continued to  advance at about the fast pace that it had on  the average during the first quarter.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen over the past 4 weeks to the level prevailing at the beginning of the year. The trade deficit in the first quarter widened substantially from the already large deficit recorded in the final quarter of 1977.  M-1, which had grown moderately in the first quarter, rose sharply in April. Growth in M-2 and M-3 also stepped up but much less than growth in M-1, because inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in these aggregates remained slow. Market interest rates have increased in recent weeks. On May 11 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 6-1/2 to 7 per cent was announced.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and con tributing to a sustainable pattern of inter national transactions.  At its meeting on April 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 appears to be consistent with these objectives.

Willes and Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services has grown rapidly on the average in the current quarter as activity rebounded from the effects of the unusually severe winter weather and the lengthy coal strike, but the rate of advance most recently appears to be slowing. Following substantial gains in March and April, increases in industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment moderated in May and retail sales changed little. The unemployment rate edged up from 6.0 to 6.1 per cent in association with a large increase in the civilian labor force. Average wholesale prices rose somewhat less rapidly in May than earlier in 1978, reflecting smaller reported increases in farm products and processed foods.  So far this year prices have increased at a considerably faster rate than they had on average during 1977. The index  of average hourly earnings also has increased at a somewhat faster pace so far in 1978 than during 1977.  Since the end of May the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined about 2 per cent, but it remains above its early-April low. The trade deficit in April was down somewhat from its very high first-quarter rate.  Growth in M-1 moderated in May from the extraordinarily rapid pace in April, and as a result growth in M-2 and M-3 also slowed. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 picked up somewhat as commercial banks increased their reliance on large-denomination time deposits to finance an unusually sharp increase in business loans. Market interest rates have risen somewhat further in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on April 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in financial markets more generally. During the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed initially at attaining a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly Federal funds rate within the range of 7-1/2 to 8 per cent. In deciding on his specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the June-July period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 5 to 10 per cent for M-1 and 6 to 10 per cent for M-2.

Baughman, Willes, and Winn dissenting, the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute trans actions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent months. Following substantial gains in March and April, increases in industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment moderated in May and June and retail sales changed little. In June, however, the unemployment rate dropped 0.4 of a percentage point to 5.7 per cent. Average producer prices rose somewhat less rapidly in May and June than earlier in 1978, but over the first half of this year prices increased at a considerably faster rate than they had on the average during 1977. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings also moderated in May and June but was at a somewhat faster pace over the first half of 1978 than during 1977.  Since mid-June the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further to its lowest level of the year. The U. S. trade deficit in May was lower than the very high rate of the first 4 months of the year.  Growth in M-1 moderated in May and June, but reflecting the extraordinarily rapid pace in April, growth from the first to the second  quarter was relatively high. Growth in M-2 and M-3 has been moderate over recent months. In June inflows of small-denomination time deposits to commercial banks and other thrift institutions picked up, following introduction of the new 6-month certificate. Market interest rates have risen further in recent weeks. On June 30 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 7 to 7-1/4 per cent was announced.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in financial markets more generally. During the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 7-3/4 to 8 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the July-August period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 per cent for M-1 and 6 to 10 per cent for M-2. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate shall be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  The Committee took note of the present state of de facto suspension of paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations as a consequence of the expiration, on April 30, 1978, of the underlying statutory authority contained in a provision of Section 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act.",197807,0,136,1978-07-31,-0.05,0.05,0.03,-0.08,-0.04,0.65,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1978-07-18

Partee and Willes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed.  until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute trans actions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is growing moderately in the current quarter, although the pace is a little less than the average for the first two quarters of the year. In July retail sales remained at about the advanced level reached in April. Industrial production and nonfarm pay roll employment continued to expand at lower rates than in the early spring months. The unemployment rate, which had dropped 0.4 of a percentage point in June, jumped 0.5 of a percentage point in July to 6.2 per cent, about the average rate in the first 5 months of the year. Average prices of goods and services have continued to rise rapidly, although producer prices of foods and foodstuffs declined in July. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977.  Since mid-July the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined sharply further. The U. S. trade deficit was lower in the second quarter than the very high rate of the first quarter.  Growth in M-1 remained moderate in July. In flows of the interest-bearing deposits included in  M-2 and M-3 picked up, owing to substantial flows into large-denomination time deposits at banks and into the new money market certificates at nonbank thrift institutions. Nevertheless, expansion in the broader aggregates also remained moderate in July. Most market interest rates have declined appreciably on balance in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic and international financial markets more generally. Early in the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed at attaining a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the August-September period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 per cent for M-1 and 6 to 10 per cent for M-2. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be significantly above or below the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate shall be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.

In August the dollar value of total retail sales rose, after having declined in July, but remained close to the level reached in April. Industrial production continued to expand at about the moderate pace of the preceding 3 months, and nonfarm payroll employment rose some what further. The unemployment rate declined from 6.2 to 5.9 per cent, slightly below the average rate in the first 7 months of the year. Since mid year average prices of goods and services have risen less rapidly than earlier, in large part because of declines in prices of foods. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977.  After a sharp decline in early August, the trade weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has recovered against a background of uncertain conditions in exchange markets. In late August it was announced that the U. S. trade deficit had increased sharply in July.  Growth in M-1 picked up in August to about the average rate in the first two quarters of the year.  Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 also accelerated somewhat, and expansion  in the broader aggregates was relatively rapid. Short-term market interest rates have risen appreciably since mid-August, but longer-term rates  generally have edged down further. On August 18 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 per cent was announced.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively.

In September, as in August, the dollar value of total retail sales rose considerably. Industrial production continued to expand while nonfarm payroll employment changed little. The unemployment rate edged up from 5.9 to 6.0 per cent. Average producer prices of finished goods rose substantially in September, as prices of foods increased sharply after having declined for 2 months. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further since mid-September in frequently volatile exchange markets. The U. S. trade deficit fell sharply in August, reversing the jump recorded in July; for the 2 months the deficit was close to the rate for the second quarter.  Growth in M-1, which had been rapid in August, accelerated in September. Inflows of the interest bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 remained strong, and expansion in the broader aggregates also accelerated somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have risen further in recent weeks; long-term rates also have increased, but they remain below their July peaks. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 7-3/4 to 8 per cent was announced on September 22; another increase to 8-1/2 per cent was announced on October 13.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and con tributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In setting ranges for the monetary aggregates, the Committee recognized the uncertainties concerning the effects that the November 1 introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) would have on measures of the money supply, especially M-1. Against that background, the Committee agreed that appropriate monetary and financial conditions would be furthered by growth of M-2 and M-3 from the third quarter of 1978 to the third quarter of 1979 within ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 per cent and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively. The narrowly defined money supply (M-1) was expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 per cent over the period, depending in part on the speed and extent of transfers from demand to savings deposits resulting from the introduction of ATS. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. Growth of M-1+ (M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks and NOW accounts) in a range of 5 to 7-1/2 per cent was thought to be generally consistent with the ranges of growth for the foregoing aggregates. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic and international financial markets more generally and to uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early in the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed at attaining a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Sub sequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by a range of tolerance for growth in M-2 over the October-November period of 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent, provided that growth of M-1 over that period does not exceed an annual rate of 6-1/2 per cent.",197810,0,139,1978-10-31,0.34,0.52,0.13,0.21,1.2,0.92,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1978-10-17

In October industrial production expanded further, nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably, and the unemployment rate declined from 6.0 to 5.8 per cent. Following 2 months of gains, the dollar value of total retail sales declined somewhat to a level slightly above the average in the third quarter. Average producer prices of finished goods rose substantially in October, as in September, in part because of further large increases in prices of foods. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it was  on the average during 1977. In late October the Government announced a new program aimed at moderating increases in prices and wages.  On November 1 a broad program to strengthen the dollar in foreign exchange markets and thereby to counter continuing domestic inflationary pressures was announced. The program included an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent, establishment of a supplementary reserve requirement of 2 per cent against member bank time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more, increases in Federal Reserve reciprocal currency arrangements with certain central banks, and other measures to mobilize key foreign currencies.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined rapidly during the last week of October, but following the actions taken to strengthen the dollar, it rose sharply to a level somewhat above that in early October. The U. S. trade deficit was about the same in the third quarter as in the second quarter.  Growth in M-1, which had been rapid in August and September, slowed markedly in October, and growth in M-2 and M-3 also moderated. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in the broader aggregates slowed some what, although sales of 6-month money market  certificates at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions expanded to record levels. Short-term market interest rates have risen substantially further since mid-October. Bond rates also have increased on balance, although they have declined appreciably since November 1; mortgage interest rates have continued to rise.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on October 17, 1978, in setting ranges for the monetary aggregates, the Committee recognized the uncertainties concerning the effects that the November 1 introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) would have on measures of the money supply, especially M-1. Against that background, the Committee agreed that appropriate monetary and financial conditions would be furthered by growth of M-2 and M-3 from the third quarter of 1978 to the third quarter of 1979 within ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 per cent and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively. The narrowly defined money supply (M-1) was expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 per cent over the period, depending in part on the speed and extent of transfers from demand to savings deposits resulting from the introduction of ATS. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. Growth  of M-1+ (M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks and NOW accounts) in a range of 5 to 7-1/2 per cent was thought to be generally  consistent with the ranges of growth for the foregoing aggregates. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar, to developing conditions in domestic financial markets, and to uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate, the Manager is to be guided mainly by a range of tolerance for the annual rate of growth over the November-December period of 6 to 9-1/2 per cent in M-2, provided that the rate of growth in M-1 does not appear to exceed 5 per cent.  The objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered within its range if the rate of growth of M-2 appears to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limit of its range. Weight is to be given to M-1 if it appears to be growing at a rate close to or above its limit.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be falling outside the limits of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",197811,0,140,1978-11-30,0.36,0.59,0.15,0.12,1.21,0.96,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1978-11-21

In November, as in October, the dollar value of total retail sales expanded substantially. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further, and the unemployment rate remained at 5.8 per cent. Over recent months, broad measures of prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen rapidly.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply following OPEC's announcement on December 17 of increased oil prices for 1979, after having declined slightly over the previous few weeks, but it remains substantially above the low reached just prior to the actions taken on November 1 to strengthen the dollar. The U. S. trade deficit in October was at about the rate recorded in the second and third quarters.  M-1 declined in November. only in part because of shifts of funds from demand deposits to savings  deposits after the introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) at the beginning of the month.  Over the first 11 months of 1978, M-1 grew at an annual rate of about 7-1/4 per cent. Growth of M-2 and M-3 slackened further in November; they grew at rates of about 8-1/4 and 9-1/4 per cent, respectively, over the first 11 months of the year. Inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions slowed in November, after having grown rapidly in the preceding 3 months. Market interest rates in general have risen further in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and con tributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on October 17, 1978, in setting ranges for the monetary aggregates, the Committee recognized the uncertainties concerning the effects that the November 1 introduction of ATS would have on measures of the money supply, especially M-1. Against that background, the Committee agreed that appropriate monetary and financial conditions would be furthered by growth of M-2 and M-3 from the third quarter of 1978 to the third quarter of 1979 within ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 per cent and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively. The narrowly defined money supply (M-1) was expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 per cent over the period, depending in part on the speed and extent of transfers from demand to savings deposits resulting from the introduction of ATS. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. Growth of M-1+ (M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks and NOW accounts) in a range of 5 to 7-1/2 per cent was thought to be generally consistent with the ranges of growth for the foregoing aggregates. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar, to developing conditions in domestic financial markets, and to uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relation ship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the December-January period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 2 to 6 per cent for M-1 and 5 to 9 per cent for M-2. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be significantly above the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate shall be raised in an orderly fashion within its range; if their rates of growth appear to be approaching the lower limits of the indicated ranges, the funds rate shall be lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be falling outside the limits of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the German Federal Bank maturing January 5, 1979, through February 15, 1979, was authorized.  Renewals for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank maturing January 5, 1979, through February 15, 1979, were noted without objection.  Pursuant to paragraph 1D of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations the Committee, by unanimous vote, expressly authorized an over-all open position in all foreign currencies of $8 billion, effective immediately. By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to raise the amount of eligible foreign currencies that the Federal Reserve would be prepared to warehouse for the U. S. Treasury, or for the Exchange Stabilization Fund of the U. S. Treasury, to $5 billion and to be prepared to warehouse such currencies for periods of up to 12 months.  By unanimous vote, transfer to the National Archives of the FOMC memoranda of discussion for 1973, on the basis described in a memorandum from the Secretariat dated December 6, 1978, was authorized.",197812,0,141,1978-12-31,0.32,0.25,0.17,0.11,0.85,1.09,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1978-12-19

In December, as in the preceding 2 months, the dollar value of total retail sales expanded substantially, and industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further. Employment continued to grow in January, and the unemployment rate, at 5.8 per cent, was virtually the same as in the final months of 1978. Over recent months, broad measures of prices and the index of average hourly earnings have continued to rise rapidly.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has tended upward since the turn of the year, returning to about its level in mid-December prior to the OPEC announcement of increased oil prices. The U. S. trade deficit in the fourth quarter of 1978 was at about the same rate as in the second and third quarters.  M-1 increased little in December and appears to have declined in January, in part because of the continuing effects of the introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) on November 1, and M-2 and M-3 grew at relatively slow rates. With market interest rates relatively high, in flows to banks of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 slowed sharply, and inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions slackened further. Over the year from the fourth quarter of 1977 to the fourth quarter of 1978 M-1, M-2, and M-3 grew about 7-1/4, 8-1/2, and 9-1/2 per cent, respectively. Most market interest rates have declined on balance in recent weeks.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustain able pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent, 5 to 8 per cent, and 6 to 9 per cent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets. In the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining the weekly average Federal funds rate at about the current level, provided that over the February-March period the annual rates of growth of M-1 and M-2, given approximately equal weight, appear to be within ranges of 3 to 7 per cent and 5 to 9 per cent, respectively. If growth of M-1 and M-2 for the 2-month period appears to be outside the indicated limits, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then consult with the Committee to determine whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions.  By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the German Federal Bank maturing February 23, 1979, through March 30, 1979, was authorized.  Renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the Swiss National Bank maturing February 23, 1979, through March 30, 1979, was noted without objection.

Coldwell, Kimbrel, Volcker, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that in the current quarter growth in real output of goods and services has moderated from the rapid rate in the last quarter of 1978, while the rise in prices has accelerated. In January and February the dollar value of total retail sales rose slightly further. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand over the two-month period, but in part because of severe weather, industrial production increased little. The unemployment rate in February, at 5.7 per cent, was virtually unchanged from its level in January and in late 1978. Over recent months, on balance, the index of average hourly earnings has continued to rise rapidly.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has shown no net change since early February. The U. S. trade deficit in January was larger than the monthly average in the fourth quarter of 1978, to some extent because of a bulge in imports of oil.  M-1 declined in both January and February, in part because of the continuing effects of the growth of the automatic transfer service. With market interest rates continuing high, inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 remained at reduced levels, despite substantial flows into money market certificates at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions. Over the two months, consequently, M-2 changed little and M-3 grew at a relatively slow rate. The behavior of all three monetary aggregates was affected by shifts of funds from deposits to money market mutual funds and other liquid assets. Most market interest rates have risen in recent weeks, after having declined in January.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of  the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate at about the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the March-April period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 percent for M-1 and and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M-2. If, with approximately equal weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be significantly above or below the mid points of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",197903,0,144,1979-03-31,0.21,0.52,0.1,0.58,1.41,0.46,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1979-03-20

Coldwell, Volcker, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute trans actions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that in the first quarter of 1979 growth in real output of goods and services slowed substantially from the rapid rate in the last quarter of 1978, while the rise in prices accelerated. In March the dollar value of total retail sales, industrial production, and nonfarm payroll employment expanded considerably, but part of the strength was attributable to recovery from the effects of severe weather in the pre ceding two months. For the first quarter as a whole, retail sales in real terms dec lined somewhat, following a sharp increase in the fourth quarter of 1978, and the advance in industrial output slowed appreciably. Growth in employment remained strong in the quarter, however, and the unemployment rate in March, at 5.7 percent, was virtually  unchanged from its level in late 1978 and the first two months of 1979. Over recent months, broad measures of prices have increased at a faster pace than during 1978, and the index of average hourly earnings has continued to rise rapidly.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen over the past four weeks, with the dollar showing particular strength against the yen, the Swiss franc, and the mark. The U. S. trade deficit in February was about half the size of the large deficit in January, but the average for the two months was above the monthly average in the fourth quarter of 1978.  M-1 increased slightly in March after having declined in both January and February. With market interest rates continuing high, inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 remained at reduced levels, despite substantial flows into money market certificates at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions, and the broader monetary aggregates continued to grow at relatively slow rates. From the fourth quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979, M-1 declined at an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent, in part because of the effects of the growth of the automatic transfer service, and M-2 and M-3 grew at rates of about 1-1/2 percent and 4-1/2 percent, respectively. behavior of all three monetary aggregates was affected by shifts of funds from deposits to money market mutual funds and other liquid assets. Since mid-March, market interest rates generally have risen somewhat, on balance.  Taking account of past and prospective [prospective] developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade, and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979  within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the April-May period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 percent for M-1 and 4 to 8-1/2 percent for M-2. If, with approximately equal weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  By unanimous vote, System renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the German Federal Bank  maturing in the period May 7-9, 1979, was noted without objection.

Balles, Partee, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a moderate pickup in growth of real output of goods and services in the current quarter from the sharply reduced pace in the first quarter, when public and private construction activity was adversely affected by unusually severe weather. In April, however, industrial production declined and growth in nonfarm pay roll employment slowed, in large part owing to effects of a work stoppage in the trucking industry early in the month. The unemployment rate, at 5.8 percent, remained at about the level prevailing earlier in the year. The dollar value of total retail sales rose some what in April, although apparently by less than the increase in average prices. Over recent months, broad measures of prices have increased at a faster pace than during 1978, and the index of average hourly earnings has continued to rise rapidly.  Demand for the dollar has continued strong in exchange markets over the past five weeks, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen further. The U. S. trade deficit declined further in March and was slightly lower in the first quarter as a whole than in the fourth quarter of 1978.  M-1 expanded sharply in April, after having declined in the first quarter, and M-2 and M-3 grew rapidly. The interest-bearing component of M-2 also grew rapidly, following several months of slow growth, as net flows into money market certificates at commercial banks increased while outflows of savings deposits slowed. At nonbank thrift institutions, net flows into money market certificates moderated, and overall  inflows of funds receded from the already reduced pace of the first quarter. Since mid-April, short-term market interest rates have changed little, on balance; most longer-term rates have increased.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial  conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 6, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets.

In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the May-June period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 0 to 5 percent for M-1 and 4 to 8-1/2 percent for M-2. If, with approximately equal weight given  to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",197905,0,146,1979-05-31,0.38,0.75,0.09,0.42,1.65,0.4,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1979-05-22

During the quarter, the dollar value of retail sales declined, and in real terms, sales in June were substantially below last December. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed during the quarter to a pace considerably below the preceding six months, but the unemployment rate in June, at 5.6 percent, was somewhat lower than earlier in the year. Industrial production recovered in May, after having declined in April in large part because of a work stoppage.  Over the first half of this year, broad measures of prices increased at a much faster pace than during 1978, although producer prices of foods declined in the second quarter. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings has slowed in recent months.  Downward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets emerged in mid-June after several  months of strength, and since then the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined about 3 percent. The U.S. trade deficit for April and May combined widened somewhat from the first-quarter rate.  M-1 expanded sharply in June, after having increased little in May, and M-2 and M-3 also grew rapidly. Inflows  of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 grew rapidly in June, as net flows into money market certificates at commercial banks expanded further and savings deposits increased for the first time since last September. At nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of deposits picked up from the sharply reduced pace in May. On a quarterly average basis, M-1 grew at an annual rate of about 7-1/2 percent in the second quarter, compared with a decline  at a rate of about 2 percent in the first quarter; M-2 and M-3 grew at rates of about 8-1/2 percent and 7-3/4 percent respectively in the second quarter, compared with rates of about 1-3/4 percent and 4-3/4 percent in the first quarter. Market interest rates in general have declined substantially over the past several weeks, but mortgage interest rates have risen further.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February. Having established the range for M-1 in February on the assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year, the Committee also agreed that actual growth in M-1 might vary in relation to its range to the extent of any deviation from that estimate. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate at about the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the July August period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M-1 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for M-2. If, with approximately equal weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",197907,0,148,1979-07-31,-0.1,-0.1,0.01,-0.01,-0.19,0.5,0.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1979-07-11

Black and Rice dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is continuing to decline in the current quarter, while prices on the average are continuing to rise rapidly. In July the dollar value of retail sales edged up; in real terms, sales were still substantially below those of last December. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed considerably further, but the unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent, remained within the narrow range prevailing since the beginning of the year. Industrial production declined in June, and it apparently slackened further in July to about the level of last December. So far this year, broad measures of prices have increased at a much faster pace than during 1978, although producer prices of foods have declined since March. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings, which had slowed in May and June, picked up in July.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined some what further in the second half of July, and although it subsequently recovered, it remained below its level of early June. The U. S. trade deficit in the second quarter was larger than in the previous quarter, reflecting largely the significant rise in the price and value of oil imports.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 remained rapid in July. Inflows of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 were slightly stronger than in June. At nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of deposits declined somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have risen over recent weeks,  while long-term rates have changed little on balance. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 9-1/2 to 10 percent was announced on July 20.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustain able pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February. Having established the range for M-1 in February on the assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would  dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year, the Committee also agreed that actual growth in M-1 might vary in relation to its range to the extent of any deviation from that estimate. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth. quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest bearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly average federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager for Domestic Operations shall be guided mainly by the relation ship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the August-September period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 percent for M-1 and 7 to 11 percent for M-2. If rates of growth of M-1 and M-2, given approximately equal weight, appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager shall promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to read as follows:  The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or, under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank) (a) to lend to the Treasury such amounts of securities held in the System Open Market Account as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, under such conditions as the Committee may specify; and (b) to purchase directly from the Treasury for renewable periods not to exceed thirty days, when authorized by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to an affirmative vote of not less than five members, for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate of 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York at the time of such purchases and provided that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $2 billion.  By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the guidelines for lending securities from the System Open Market Account to  the Treasury recommended by FOMC staff in a memorandum dated August 8, 1979, except that the Committee approved a charge for borrowed securities at a rate of 1/8 of 1 percent per annum.",197908,0,149,1979-08-31,-0.64,-0.27,0.22,-0.15,-0.84,-0.33,-0.22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1979-08-14

Balles, Black, Coldwell and Rice dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that in the third quarter real output of goods and services remained near the reduced level of the preceding quarter and that prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. In August, as in July, the dollar value of retail sales expanded moderately, but sales in real terms changed little and were substantially below those of last December. Industrial production dropped from the May-July level, largely because of sharp curtailments in output of motor vehicles and parts. Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged; the unemployment rate rose from 5.7 percent to 6.0 per cent, thus moving above the narrow range in which it had fluctuated since the beginning of the year. Producer prices of finished goods continued to rise rapidly in August, led by further large increases in energy items and a substantial advance in consumer foods following a significant decline over the preceding four months. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings over the first eight months of this year was moderately below the pace during 1978, but the increase in total hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector has been about as rapid this year as last.  The dollar came under downward pressure in foreign exchange markets in the last days of August and the early days of September, but its trade weighted value against major foreign currencies has changed little on balance since mid-August. The U. S. trade deficit in July was sharply reduced  from the average in the first half of the year.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 was relatively rapid in August and early September, although not so rapid as in June and July. Market interest rates have risen appreciably over recent weeks. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 10 to 10-1/2 percent was announced on August 16.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market  Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February. Having established the range for M-1 in February on the assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year, the Committee also agreed that actual growth in M-1 might vary in relation to its range to the extent of any deviation from that estimate. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.

At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 per cent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February. The range for M-1 had been established on the basis of an assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year. It now appears that expansion of such accounts will dampen growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points over the year; thus, the equivalent range for M-1 is now 3 to 6 percent. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to restrain expansion of reserve aggregates to a pace consistent with deceleration in growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 in the fourth quarter of 1979 to rates that would hold growth of these monetary aggregates over the whole period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within the Committee's longer-run ranges, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent. The Committee will consider the need for supplementary instructions if it appears that operations to restrain expansion of reserve aggregates would maintain the federal funds rate near the upper limit of its range.",197910,0,151,1979-10-31,0.05,0.07,-0.02,-0.08,0.02,-0.27,-0.08,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1979-10-06

Retail sales, which had expanded sharply during the third quarter in both constant and current dollars, dropped in October. Industrial production remained near its midyear level. Nonfarm payroll employment rose consider ably, after three months of little growth, but the unemployment rate increased from 5.8 to 6.0 percent. Producer prices of finished goods continued to rise rapidly in October, in part because of further sharp increases in energy items and the spreading effects of earlier increases in energy costs. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings during the first 10 months of the year was close to the rapid pace during 1978.  On October 6 the Federal Reserve announced a series of complementary actions directed toward assuring control over the expansion.of money and bank credit and toward curbing speculative excesses in commodity and financial markets, including foreign exchange markets. The actions included an increase in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates from 11 per cent to 12 percent; establishment of a marginal reserve requirement on increases in the total of managed liabilities of member banks, Edge corporations, and U. S. agencies and branches of foreign banks; and a shift in the conduct of open market operations to an approach placing greater emphasis in day-to-day operations on the supply of bank reserves and less emphasis on confining short-term fluctuations in the federal funds rate.  Following the announcement on October 6, the downward pressure on the dollar in the exchange markets that had developed in September was reversed, and by the end of October the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies had risen about 3-1/2 percent. In mid-November, however, the value of the dollar declined, reflecting in part developments concerning Iran. The U. S. foreign trade deficit increased in September as the cost of oil imports rose, but the deficit was somewhat lower for the third quarter as a whole than for the second quarter.  Growth of M-1, which had accelerated in September and was exceptionally rapid in the third quarter as a whole, slowed sharply in October to an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent. Expansion of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 remained strong, as a rise in net flows into time deposits at commercial banks in response to increased yields offset a contraction in savings deposits. Inflows of deposits at nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat. Flows into money market mutual funds accelerated. Growth of commercial bank credit moderated in October; nevertheless, banks increased their reliance on the negotiable, large-denomination CD's and other managed liabilities that became subject to the marginal reserve requirement in the statement week beginning October 11. Both short- and long-term market interest rates have risen sharply on balance since the early October announcement of the System's policy actions, although most recently rates have declined; mortgage interest rates have increased substantially further.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 per cent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges  that had been established in February. The range for M-1 had been established originally on the basis of an assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over  the year. It now appears that expansion of such accounts will dampen growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points over the year; thus after allowance for the deviation from the earlier estimate, the equivalent range for M-1 is now 3 to 6 percent. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to restrain expansion of reserve aggregates to a pace consistent with deceleration in growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 in the fourth quarter of 1979 to rates that would hold growth of these monetary aggregates over the whole period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within the Committee's longer-run ranges, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the.Committee.  By unanimous vote, responsibility for making determinations with respect to appeals of denial of access to Committee records, under the provisions of 271.4(d) of the Committee's Rules Regarding Availability of Information, was delegated to Mr. Schultz, and in his absence, to Mr. Coldwell.

In November retail sales strengthened and nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further, but industrial production declined some what and private housing starts fell. The unemployment rate edged down from 6.0 to 5.8 percent. Producer prices of finished goods and consumer prices continued to rise  rapidly, in part because of the spreading effects of earlier increases in energy costs.  Over recent months the rise in the index of average hourly  earnings has remained close to the rapid pace during 1978.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has depreciated about 3 percent since mid-November, reflecting in large part the mid-East situation as well as a firming of monetary conditions in a number of foreign countries. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in October and November on the average was slightly below the rate for the third quarter.  Growth of the major monetary aggregates, which had slowed in October, remained at reduced rates in the final months of 1979. From the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 M-1 grew 5-1/2 percent, M-2 about 8-1/4 percent, and M-3 about 8 percent. Most market interest rates have declined somewhat on balance since the Committee's meeting in late November.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 per cent respectively. It appeared that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth of M-1 by about 1-1/2 percentage points over the year, half as much as assumed early in the year; thus after allowance for the deviation from the earlier estimate, the equivalent range for M-1 was 3 to 6 percent. The associated range for bank credit was 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipated that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts. Ranges for 1980 will be reconsidered at the meeting of the Committee scheduled for early February.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first quarter of 1980 at an annual rate between 4 and 5 percent for M-1 and on the order of 7 percent for M-2, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Coldwell and Wallich dissenting, the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services expanded some what in the final quarter of 1979 and that prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. In December retail sales strengthened, industrial production edged up, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to rise, while private housing starts remained at the reduced level of November. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in January, but the unemployment rate rose from 5.9 to 6.2 percent. Producer prices of finished goods and consumer prices continued to rise rapidly toward the end of 1979, in part because of  the spreading effects of earlier increases in energy costs. Over the past several months the rise in the index of average hourly earnings has remained close to the rapid pace recorded earlier in 1979.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies changed little in January,  and exchange market pressures were relatively slight in spite of increased international political tensions.  The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose in December, in large part because of an increase in imports of petroleum.  Growth of the major monetary aggregates, which had subsided in the final months of 1979, remained at reduced rates in January. Most market interest rates, especially long-term rates, have risen since the Committee's meeting in early January.   Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustain able pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from  the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 31⁄2 to 6, 4 to 61⁄2, 6 to 9, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first quarter of 1980 at an annual rate of about 4 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 111⁄2 to 15 percent. The Committee believes that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 as newly defined should grow at an annual rate of about 6 percent over the first quarter.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee",198002,1,155,1980-02-29,-0.18,-0.14,-0.17,-0.2,-0.69,-0.29,-0.16,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1980-02-05

In February retail sales declined moderately, but the decrease followed an exceptionally large increase in January. Industrial production expanded somewhat in both months, after a period of little change, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to rise. The unemployment rate edged down in February to 6.0 percent. Private housing starts declined further in January and were more than one-fifth below the rate in the third quarter of last year. The rise in producer prices of finished goods and in consumer prices was more  rapid in the first month or two of 1980 than in 1979, despite some easing in prices of foods. Over the first two months of 1980 the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat below the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The dollar has been in strong demand in exchange markets since mid-February, largely in response to rising U. S. interest rates; by early March the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies had returned to about the level reached at the end of last October, and since then, it has risen further. Intervention by foreign monetary authorities to support their currencies was very heavy in February and the first half of March. The U. S. foreign trade deficit rose sharply in January,although the volume and value of imports of petroleum were somewhat reduced.  Growth of M-1A and M-1B, which had remained moderate in January, accelerated sharply in February, and growth of M-2 also quickened. In recent weeks, however, monetary growth has subsided. Expansion of commercial bank credit picked up in the first two months of this year from the reduced pace in the fourth quarter of 1979. Market interest  rates have risen substantially in recent weeks. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 12 to 13 percent was announced early on February 15, effectively immediately.  On March 14 the President announced a broad program of fiscal, energy, credit, and other measures designed to moderate and reduce inflationary forces in a manner that can also lay the groundwork for a return to stable economic growth. Consistent with that objective and with the continuing intent of the Federal Reserve System to restrain growth in money and credit during 1980, the Board of Governors took the following actions to rein force the effectiveness of the measures announced in October 1979: 1. A special credit restraint program; 2. A special deposit requirement for all lenders on increases in certain types of consumer credit; 3. An increase in the marginal reserve requirement on managed liabilities of large member banks; 4. A special deposit requirement on increases in managed liabilities of large nonmember banks; 5. A special deposit requirement on increases in total assets of money market mutual funds; 6. A surcharge of 3 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large member banks from Federal Reserve Banks.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first half of 1980 at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, or somewhat less, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 13 to 20 percent. The Committee believes that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 should grow at an annual rate of about 7-3/4 percent over the first half and expansion of bank credit should slow in the months ahead to a pace compatible with growth over the year as a whole within the range agreed upon.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first regular meeting in March of every year.",198003,1,156,1980-03-31,-0.52,-0.22,-0.25,-0.53,-1.51,-0.72,-0.34,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1980-03-18

By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period  March 18 through April 21, 1980, were ratified. With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account  in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity turned down in the latter part of the first quarter of 1980, although for the quarter as a whole real GNP expanded somewhat further and the rise in prices accelerated. Retail sales in real terms declined sharply in February and March, after having increased in January. In March industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment declined, and the un employment rate edged up to 6.2 percent. Private housing starts declined throughout the first quarter, to a rate in March about two-fifths below that in the third quarter of last year. The rise in producer prices of finished goods and in consumer prices was considerably more rapid during the first three months of 1980 than in 1979. Over the first quarter, the  rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat above the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The strong demand for the dollar in exchange markets that began in mid-February persisted through early April. Some selling pressure developed in the second week of April as market participants reacted to indications that U.S. interest rates might have peaked, but the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies remained well above its level of early February. The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose further in February.  M-1A and M-1B, which had expanded sharply in February, contracted in March and early April; M-2 increased relatively little in March. From December to March, M-1A and M-1B grew at annual rates of about 4 percent and 4-1/2 percent respectively, and M-2 grew at a rate of 7 percent. Expansion of commercial bank credit slowed substantially in March from the accelerated pace earlier in the year. Since mid March, most market interest rates on balance have declined considerably.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustain able pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.

The Committee believes that, to be consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 should grow at an annual rate of about 6-3/4 percent over the first half and that bank credit should grow in the months ahead at a pace compatible with growth over the year as a whole within the range agreed upon.

Partee and Roos dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a marked contraction in real GNP in the current quarter. In April the dollar value of total retail sales declined substantially for the third consecutive month. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment were curtailed sharply, and the unemployment rate rose from 6.2 to 7.0 percent. Private housing starts, which had declined throughout the first quarter to a relatively low rate, edged down further in April. The overall rise in prices of goods and services has remained rapid in recent months, although in April the rise in producer prices of finished goods was slowed by a large decrease in foods and by a lessening of the rapid rise in energy items. Over the first four months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat less than the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets that emerged in early April has continued over most of the past four weeks, in response primarily to the sharp decline in U. S. interest rates relative to foreign interest rates; the trade weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined about 3-1/2 percent. The U. S. foreign trade deficit was substantially larger in the first quarter of 1980 than in the preceding quarter, despite a considerable decline in March from the average in the preceding two months.  M-1A and M-1B contracted sharply further in April, and M-2 also declined. Commercial bank credit, both loans and investments, contracted in April after having slowed substantially in March. Over recent weeks, market interest rates have declined sharply further.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and con tributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 at rates high enough to promote achievement of the Committee's objectives for monetary growth over the year, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 8-1/2 to 14 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",198005,1,158,1980-05-31,-1.68,-1.13,-0.21,-0.58,-3.61,-2.87,-0.85,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1980-05-20

In May total retail sales declined substantially for the fourth consecutive month, and housing starts, industrial production, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline. Employment fell sharply further in June; however, the unemployment rate edged down from 7.8 to 7.7 percent, following large increases in April and May. The overall rise in prices of goods and services has moderated in recent months, in large part owing to a lessening of the rapid rise in energy items. Over the first six months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was moderately faster than the pace recorded in 1979.  The downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets that emerged in early April abated in mid-June, and then was resumed in early July. The average U.S. foreign trade deficit for April and May was well below the average for the first quarter, reflecting reduced oil and non-oil imports.  Monetary expansion was rapid in June, following weakness earlier in the spring. Over the first half of the year growth of M-1A and M-1B fell short of the rates consistent with the Committee's ranges for the year from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980; the rate of growth for M-2 was just above the lower bound of its range. Outstanding bank loans to business declined substantially during the second quarter following a large increase in the first quarter. Market interest rates declined considerably further in late May and the first half of June, but  since then most rates have retraced part of the decline. Reductions in Federal Reserve discount rates from 13 to 11 percent in equal steps were announced on May 28 and June 12.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agrees that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the third quarter of 1980 at annual rates of about 7 percent, 8 percent, and 8 percent respectively, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 8-1/2 to 14 percent.

While industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline sharply in June, total retail sales advanced after four months of substantial decreases, and housing starts rose from a de pressed level. In July retail sales advanced further; nonfarm payroll employment declined, but not so sharply as during the second quarter, and the unemployment rate edged up from 7.7 to 7.8 percent. The overall rise in prices of goods and services moderated in the second quarter, in large part owing to a lessening  of the rapid rise in energy items. Over the first seven months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was some what faster than the pace recorded in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has risen somewhat since late July, after having fluctuated in a narrow range earlier in the month. A reduced U.S. foreign trade deficit in June brought the average for the second quarter well below the average for the first quarter.  Monetary expansion remained rapid in July, although not so rapid as in June. The recent resurgence brought growth of M-1A closer to and that of M-1B about to the lower bounds of the Committee's ranges for the year from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980. However, the rate of growth for M-2 was near the upper bound of its range. Market interest rates have risen considerably further in recent weeks.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 31⁄2 to 6 percent, 4 to 61⁄2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. For the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, the Committee looked toward a reduction in the ranges for growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 on the order of 1⁄2 percentage point from the ranges adopted for 1980, abstracting from institutional influences affect ing the behavior of the aggregates. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the third quarter of 1980 at annual rates of about 61⁄2 percent, 9 percent, and 12 percent respectively, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 8 to 14 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",198008,0,161,1980-08-31,0.14,0.39,-0.01,-0.01,0.52,-0.91,-0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1980-08-12

Guffey, Roos, Wallich, and Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the decline in economic activity has moderated in the third quarter following a sharp contraction in the second quarter. Industrial production and nonfarm pay roll employment expanded in August after several months of decline; the unemployment rate edged down from 7.8 to 7.6 percent; and total retail sales advanced considerably further. In July housing starts rose slightly, following a substantial rebound in June, and were well above the depressed levels of the preceding three months. Producer prices of finished goods rose rapidly in July and August, after increasing at a sharply reduced pace in the second quarter; the recent advance reflected mainly a surge in food prices. Over the first eight months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat faster than the pace recorded in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has declined somewhat over the past five weeks. The U.S. trade deficit in July was significantly lower than the monthly average in the second quarter, reflecting a sharp decline in petroleum imports.  M-1A and M-1B grew at record rates in August, while growth in M-2 moderated from an exceptionally rapid pace in June and July. For the year through August growth of M-1A was in the lower half and growth of M-1B in the upper half of their respective ranges set by the Committee for the year from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, while growth in M-2 was somewhat above the upper limit of its range. Market interest rates have fluctuated widely since mid-August and on balance short-term rates have risen considerably while long-term rates have increased moderately.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 31⁄2 to 6 percent, 4 to 61⁄2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent respectively.

These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the August to December period at annual rates of about 4 percent, 61⁄2 percent, and 81⁄2 percent respectively, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 8 to 14 percent.

Morris, Roos, Wallich,and Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until other  wise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP increased somewhat in the third quarter following the sharp contraction in the second quarter, while prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. The recovery in retail sales and housing starts that began in June continued during the third quarter. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded in September for the second consecutive month, and the unemployment rate edged down from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings moderated in the third quarter, but the rise over the first nine months of the year was about as rapid as in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in ex change markets on balance has risen somewhat over the past month. The U.S. trade deficit in August remained well below the monthly average in the second quarter.  M-1A and M-1B continued to grow rapidly in September, although not so rapidly as in August, while growth in M-2 moderated further. From the fourth quarter of 1979 to September, growth of M-1A was slightly above the midpoint of the range set by the Committee for growth over the year ending in the fourth quarter of 1980, while growth of M-1B and M-2 was somewhat above the upper limits of their ranges. Expansion in commercial bank credit was relatively rapid in both August and September. On balance short-term market interest rates have risen considerably further since mid September while long-term rates have changed little; average rates on new home mortgage commitments have continued upward. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 10 to 11 percent was announced on September 25.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3 to 6 percent, 4 to 6 per cent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively.

In October industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded substantially for the third consecutive month, and the un employment rate remained around 7 percent. The value of retail sales changed little, following four months of recovery. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings over the first ten months of 1980 was somewhat more rapid than in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets on balance has risen further over the past month.  The U.S. trade deficit was essentially unchanged in September, and the rate in the third quarter was sharply lower than that in the first half.  Growth in M-1A and M-1B moderated further in October but was still relatively rapid; growth in M-2 accelerated slightly, reflecting a pickup in expansion of its non transactions component. From the fourth quarter of 1979 to October, growth of M-1A was in the upper part of the range set by the Committee for growth over the year ending in the fourth quarter of 1980, while growth of M-1B and M-2 was somewhat above the upper limits of their ranges. Expansion in commercial bank credit was rapid in October, although not so rapid as in August and September. Market interest rates have risen sharply in recent weeks; average rates on new home mortgage commitments have continued upward.  On November 14 the Board of Governors announced an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 11 to 12 percent and a surcharge of 2 percentage points on frequent borrowing of large member banks from Federal Reserve banks.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3 to 6 percent, 4 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively.

In November retail sales, industrial production, and nonfarm  payroll employment expanded substantially further, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 7 percent. Housing starts remained at their September-October level. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat more rapid this year than in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has risen considerably further over the past month.  The U.S. trade deficit was unchanged in October, remaining well below the rate in the first half.  Growth in M-1A and M-1B continued to moderate in November but was still relatively rapid; growth in M-2 continued to accelerate, reflecting a further pickup in expansion of its nontransaction component. In early December, growth of M-1A and M-1B slowed substantially further. From the fourth quarter of 1979 to November, growth of M-1A was in the upper part of the range set by the Committee for growth over the year ending in the fourth quarter of 1980; M-1B and M-2 grew at rates some what above the upper limits of their respective ranges. Expansion in commercial bank credit was about as rapid in November as on the average in the preceding three months. Short-term market interest rates have risen sharply further in recent weeks. Long-term market yields have also risen, although considerably less, and average rates on new home mortgage commitments have continued upward. On December 4 the Board of Governors announced an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 12 to 13 percent and an increase in the surcharge from 2 to 3 percentage points on frequent  borrowing of large institutions.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.

The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  For the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, the Committee looked toward a reduction in the ranges for growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 on the order of 1⁄2 percentage point from the ranges adopted for 1980, abstracting from institutional influences affecting the behavior of the aggregates.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates associated with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the first quarter along a path consistent with the ranges for growth in 1981 contemplated earlier, which will be reviewed in February 1981. Those ranges, abstracting from the effects of deposit shifts connected with the introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, imply growth in these aggregates centered on 4-1/4 percent, 4-3/4 percent, and 7 percent respectively. It is recognized that the introduction of NOW and ATS accounts nationwide at the beginning of 1981 is likely to widen the discrepancy between growth in M-1A and M-1B to an extent that cannot now be accurately estimated, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those differences as they emerge. In the light of the rapid growth of monetary and credit aggregates in recent months, some shortfall in growth would be acceptable in the near term if that developed in the context of reduced  pressures in the money market. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 15 to 20 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",198012,0,165,1980-12-31,0.14,0.26,0.03,0.03,0.45,1.03,0.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1980-12-19

In December industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded further, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at about 7-1/2 per cent. Retail sales declined, however, following a sizable gain over the preceding six months. Housing starts were about unchanged for the third month. Over the last few months of 1980, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was at about the rapid pace recorded earlier in the year.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has risen further over the past six weeks. The U.S. trade deficit in the final quarter of 1980 widened from the exceptionally low rate in the third quarter but remained substantially less than the rate in the first half.  M-1A and M-1B declined sharply in December; in January, after adjustment of the actual figures for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, these aggregates recovered in part. Growth in M-2 slowed markedly in December but accelerated in January. Some moderation of the expansion in commercial bank credit in December and early January was accompanied by stepped up financing of nonfinancial businesses through issuance of commercial paper and longer-term debt instruments. Market interest rates have declined on balance from their highs of mid-December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and con tribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2,and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1A and M-1B from December to March at annual rates of 5 to 6 per cent and in M-2 at a rate of about 8 percent, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts. These rates are associated with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the first quarter of 1981 at annual rates of about 2 percent, 2-3/4 percent, and 7 percent respectively. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1A and M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 15 to 20 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",198102,0,167,1981-02-28,-0.45,-0.02,-0.08,-0.09,-0.64,-0.18,-0.11,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1981-02-03

While retail sales advanced appreciably over the first two months of the year, industrial production declined in February after three months of diminishing gains and housing starts dropped from the moderate pace that had prevailed during the preceding six months. Nonfarm payroll employment changed little in February following a large in crease in January; the unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent, was essentially unchanged. Over the first two months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was little changed from the rapid pace recorded during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose further following the Committee's meeting in early February to a peak at midmonth but subsequently declined somewhat on balance. Short-term interest rates in continental European countries have risen appreciably since mid-February, absolutely and in relation to interest rates on dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. trade deficit in January and February was at about the average monthly rate of the final quarter of 1980.  M-1A and M-1B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, changed little over the first two  months of the year but expanded substantially in the first half of March. Growth in M-2 accelerated in the course.of the quarter and partial data suggest considerable strength in March, in part because of large flows into money market mutual funds. On balance since early February, short-term  market interest rates have fallen substantially while longer term market rates have risen somewhat.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1B from March to June at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts, and growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about 10-1/2 percent. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 13 to 18 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",198103,0,168,1981-03-31,0.08,0.18,-0.02,-0.26,-0.02,-0.34,-0.22,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1981-03-31

The dollar value of total retail sales increased slightly further  in March, but it declined appreciably in April when sales of new cars fell in response to the ending of price concessions.  Industrial production rose moderately in both months, while nonfarm payroll employment changed little, after adjustment  for strikes, and the unemployment rate was stable at 7.3 percent. In March housing starts remained at a reduced pace. Over the first four months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was slightly less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen steadily since the end of March to its highest level in three and a half years. The U.S. trade deficit declined sharply in March, bringing the first quarter deficit to a level well below the 1980 average.  Growth in M-1B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, accelerated sharply in April and growth in M-2 remained rapid. Since March, both short-term and long-term market interest rates have risen substantially. On May 4 the Board of Governors announced an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 13 to 14 percent and an increase in the surcharge from 3 to 4 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large institutions.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation,  promote economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5 percent, 31 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with a substantial deceleration of growth  in M-1B from April to June to an annual rate of 3 percent or lower, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts,  and with growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about 6 percent.  The shortfall in growth of M-1B from the two-month rate specified above would be acceptable, in light of the rapid growth in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5 percent or somewhat less. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 16 to 22 percent.",198105,0,170,1981-05-31,0.22,-0.09,-0.11,-0.12,-0.1,-0.01,0.1,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1981-05-18

The dollar value of total retail sales was virtually unchanged in May after having declined appreciably in April, and sales of new cars remained weak in June. Industrial production rose slightly on the average in April and May, while non farm payroll employment continued to advance, after adjustment for strikes. In June strike-adjusted nonfarm employment declined appreciably; the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent, somewhat lower than in May but unchanged from earlier months of 1981. In May housing starts declined sharply. Over the first six months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was slightly less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to rise through May and early  June and then leveled off. In April-May the U.S. foreign trade deficit was somewhat above the first-quarter rate.  M1-B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, declined substantially in May and June following the sharp expansion in April, and growth in M2 slowed. The level of adjusted M1-B in the second quarter on the average was below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 in the second quarter was slightly above the upper end of its range for the year. Since mid-May, on balance, short-term market interest rates have declined somewhat while long-term yields generally have changed little.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote sustained economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M1-A, M1-B, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 51⁄2 percent, 31⁄2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates has been running somewhat above the upper ends of the ranges. The Committee reaffirmed its ranges for 1981, but in light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range. At the same time, growth in the broader aggregates may be high in their ranges. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. also tentatively agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 21⁄2 to 51⁄2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent would be appropriate. These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from June to September at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts (resulting in growth at an annual rate of about 2 percent from the average in the second quarter to the average in the third quarter), provided that growth of M2 remains around the upper limit of, or moves within, its range for the year. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M1-B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 15 to 21 percent.",198107,0,172,1981-07-31,0.13,0.13,-0.12,-0.03,0.11,-0.15,-0.08,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1981-07-07

The dollar value of total retail sales increased appreciably further in July, reflecting some recovery in sales at automotive dealers. Industrial production rose slightly in July, while nonfarm payroll employment advanced substantially; the unemployment rate declined to 7.0 percent, somewhat below its average level in earlier months of 1981. In June housing starts declined sharply further. Over the first seven months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar rose further against major foreign currencies in July and early August, registering gains against all major currencies. In June the U.S. foreign trade deficit declined slightly from the May level, but for the second quarter the deficit was up substantially over the first-quarter rate.  In July M1-B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, expanded somewhat following a substantial decline in May and June, and growth in M2 accelerated from a relatively sluggish pace in the previous two months. The level of adjusted M1-B in July was well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 while the level of M2 was slightly below the upper end of its range for the year. Available data for early August suggested further acceleration in growth of M1-B and M2, with acceleration in M2 apparently influenced in part by initial responses of the public to the availability of more attractive deposit instruments, pointing up the necessity of evaluating the behavior of M2 in the light of the impact of regulatory and legislative changes. Since early July most market interest rates have risen considerably on balance.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote sustained economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by re affirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges included growth of 31⁄2 to 6 percent for M1-B, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, and growth of 6 to 9 percent and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent for M2 and M3, respectively. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been running at about or somewhat above the upper ends of their ranges. In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range. At the same time, growth in the broader aggregates might be high in their ranges. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee also tentatively agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 21⁄2 to 51⁄2 percent,  6 to 9 percent, and 61⁄2 to 91⁄2 percent would be appropriate. These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  In the short run the Committee continues to seek behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from June to September at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts (resulting in growth at an annual rate of about 2 percent from the average in the second quarter to the average in the third quarter), provided that growth of M2 remains around the upper limit of, or moves within, its range for the year.

In July and August the nominal value of total retail sales was essentially unchanged from the June level, and unit sales of domestic automobiles weakened in September. Industrial production declined slightly in August and apparently slackened further in September, while nonfarm payroll employment changed little in both months. The unemployment rate rose to 7.5 percent in September, about equal to its average in the first half of 1981. Housing starts fell in August to the lowest rate in several years. Over the first nine months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply through mid-September from its peak in early August and on balance has changed little since then. In August the U.S. foreign trade deficit widened substantially from the low rate in July; for July and August combined, the deficit was considerably larger than the second quarter rate.  M1-B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, increased little over the period from June to September, while M2 grew at a relatively strong pace. The level of adjusted M1-B in September was well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 was at the upper end of its range for the year. In frequently volatile markets, short term interest rates have declined on balance since mid-August while long-term rates have risen considerably further. On September 21 the Board of Governors announced a reduction in the surcharge from 4 to 3 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large depository institutions.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote sustained economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by re affirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges included growth of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-B, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, and growth of 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and M3, respectively. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been running at about or somewhat above the upper ends of their ranges. In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range.

These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from September to December at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts and with growth in M2 at an annual rate around 10 percent or slightly higher, recognizing that the behavior of M2 will be affected by recent regulatory and legislative changes, particularly the public's response to the availability of the all savers certificate. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next  meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 12 to 17 percent.",198110,1,175,1981-10-31,-0.57,-0.57,-0.27,-0.39,-1.8,-1.33,-0.8,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1981-10-06

In October the nominal value of total retail sales dropped; industrial production fell more than in September; and nonfarm payroll employment, especially in manufacturing, declined sharply. The unemployment rate rose from 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent. Housing starts edged down in September from an already de pressed level. Over the first 10 months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined only a little since early October, although U.S. short-term interest rates have declined more than foreign rates. A reduced U.S. foreign trade deficit in September brought the deficit for the third quarter close to the second-quarter rate.  M1-B (adjusted for estimated shifts into NOW accounts) expanded in October almost as much as it had declined in September, and growth of M2 picked up. The level of adjusted M1-B remained well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 was at the upper end of its range for the year. Short-term market interest rates have declined substantially since the end of September, and bond yields have also dropped from the peaks generally reached about then. On October 30 the Board of Governors announced a reduction in Federal Reserve basic discount rates from 14 to 13 percent. The surcharge on frequent borrowings of large depository institutions had been reduced from 3 to 2 percentage points on October 9, and on November 16 the Board removed the remaining 2 percentage points.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early July, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting.  These ranges included growth of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-B, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, and growth of 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 respectively. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been running at about or somewhat above the upper end of their ranges.

These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  The Committee, after noting a moderate shortfall in growth of M1-B in October from the target path set at the last meeting, seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from October to December at an annual rate of about 7 percent (after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts) and with growth of M2 at an annual rate around 11 percent. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 11 to 15 percent.",198111,1,176,1981-11-30,-0.8,-0.76,-0.22,-0.29,-2.07,-1.79,-0.85,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1981-11-17

In November industrial production fell more than in preceding months; nonfarm payroll employment, especially in manufacturing, declined sharply further; and the unemployment rate rose an additional 0.4 percentage points to 8.4 percent. The nominal value of retail sales increased, but the level was still well below the average for the third quarter. Housing starts remained at a depressed level. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat less rapid this year than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has changed little on balance since mid November. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in October widened substantially from the unusually low rate in September, and the average for the two months was about the same as that for July and August.  M-B (adjusted for estimated shifts into NOW accounts) expanded substantially in November and early December, but its level in November was still well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981. Growth of M2 accelerated sharply in November, raising its level above the upper end of its range for the year. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields continued to decline in the latter part of November, but since then they have risen to levels generally higher than those of mid-November; over the period since mid-November, mortgage interest rates have declined further. On December 3 the Board of Governors announced a reduction in Federal Reserve basic discount rates from 13 to 12 .percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early July, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges included growth of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M1-B, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, and growth of 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 respectively. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been running at about or somewhat above the upper end of their ranges. In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range. At the same time, growth in the broader aggregates might be high in their ranges. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee also tentatively agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively would be appropriate.  In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from November  1981 to March at annual rates of around 4 to 5 percent and 9 to 10 percent respectively. The target for M1 no longer reflects the ""shift-adjustment"" for conversion of outstanding interest-bearing assets into new NOW accounts, formerly estimated in the ""shift-adjusted"" M1-B series. In setting the M1 target the Committee took account of the relatively rapid growth that had already taken place through the first part of December; it also recognized that interpretation of actual money growth may need to take account of the significance of fluctuations in NOW accounts, which have recently been growing relatively rapidly. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 10 to 14 percent.",198112,1,177,1981-12-31,-0.99,-0.92,-0.11,-0.48,-2.5,-2.12,-0.86,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1981-12-22

In December industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment declined sharply for the third consecutive month, and the unemployment rate rose an additional 0.5 percentage point to 8.9 percent. The nominal value of retail sales increased somewhat further, but the level was still below the average for the third quarter. Although housing starts expanded, they remained at a depressed level. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings was considerably less rapid over the fourth quarter of 1981 than on the average earlier in the year.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose substantially during January; foreign monetary authorities intervened considerably to resist the depreciation of their currencies. In the fourth quarter the U.S. foreign trade deficit increased from the rate in the previous two quarters.  Ml grew rapidly in December and January, reflecting in part rapid expansion in checkable deposits other than demand accounts. Growth of M2 also was substantial, owing to strength in the more liquid of the nontransaction components as well as in M1. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields on balance have risen further in recent weeks, and mortgage interest rates have also increased.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  The Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates over the balance of the quarter consistent with bringing M1 and M2 over time into their longer-run target ranges for the year. Taking account of the recent surge in growth of M1, the Committee seeks no further growth in M1 for the January-to-March period and growth in M2 at an annual rate of around 8 percent. Some decline in M1 would be associated with more rapid attainment of the longer-run range and would be acceptable in the context of reduced pressure in the money market. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range  of 12 to 16 percent.

In January weakness in activity was accentuated by  unusually severe weather, and in February the nominal value of retail sales rebounded while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment recovered part of their January declines. The unemployment rate in February, at 8.8 percent, was unchanged from December. Although housing starts rose further in the first two months of the year, they remained  at a depressed level. The rise in both the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods moderated substantially, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings on the average remained at a reduced pace.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to rise strongly in February and March; foreign monetary authorities intervened on a substantial scale to resist the depreciation of their currencies. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in January and February on the average was somewhat less than the fourth-quarter rate.  M1 declined in February, after three months of rapid growth, and then increased moderately in early March. Growth of M2 slowed appreciably in February, owing to a slackening of the expansion in the nontransaction component as well as to the decline in M1. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields on balance have declined since early February, and mortgage interest rates have edged down.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June at annual rates of about 3 percent and 8 percent respectively. The Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be evaluated in light of the probability that M2 would be less affected over the period than M1 by deposit shifts related to the tax date and by changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle. Some shortfall in growth of M1, consistent with progress toward the upper part of the range for the year as a whole, would be acceptable in the context of appreciably reduced pressures in the money market and relative strength of other aggregates.

In April the nominal value of retail sales expanded, while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline. The unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage point to 9.4 percent. Although housing starts edged up in March for the fifth consecutive month, they remained at a depressed level. The rate of increase in prices on the average appears to be slowing somewhat further in the current quarter; so far this year both the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods have risen little on balance, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained at a reduced pace.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies, after rising somewhat further in early  April, has fallen sharply over the past month, reflecting in part a decline in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates and market expectations of further declines. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in the first quarter was one-third less than in the preceding quarter.  M1 increased sharply in April, but the expansion was concentrated in the first half of the month and was largely retraced later. Growth of M2 moderated somewhat, owing to a slackening of the expansion in the nontransaction component. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields on balance have declined since the end of March, and mortgage interest rates have edged down further.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions. At its meeting in early February,the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June at annual rates of about 3 percent and 8 percent respectively. The Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be evaluated in light of changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle.

Black and Ford, Mrs. Teeters, and Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until other wise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP changed little in the second quarter, after the appreciable further decline in the first quarter, as business inventory liquidation moderated from an extra ordinary rate. In May the nominal value of retail sales continued to pick up, while industrial production declined only a little further and nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged. The unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage point to 9.5 percent. Housing starts rose appreciably from a depressed level.  The price index for gross domestic business product appears to have risen at a relatively slow rate in the second quarter. Over the first five months of this year the producer price index for finished goods was virtually stable, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings remained at a reduced pace. The consumer price index rose sharply in May, after a small net increase over the preceding four months.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen sharply over the past month, reaching its highest level since early 1971, in response to a rise in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates as well as to hostilities in the Middle East. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in the first five months of 1982 was at a rate substantially less than in the fourth quarter of last year, as imports declined more than exports.  M1 declined somewhat in May, after its sharp rise in April, while growth of M2 remained substantial. Business demands for credit, especially short-term credit, were exceptionally strong. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields generally have risen since late May, and mortgage interest rates have increased.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges were under review at this meeting.  In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from June to September at annual rates of about 5 percent and about 9 per cent respectively. Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable depending on evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to exceptional liquidity demands and changes in financial asset holdings. It was also noted that seasonal uncertainties, together with increased social security payments and the initial impact of the tax cut on cash balances, might lead to a temporary bulge in the monetary aggregates, particularly M1. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 10 to 15 percent.

In July the nominal value of retail sales rose somewhat from a sharply reduced June level; housing starts increased substantially, though from a relatively low rate; and industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment were essentially unchanged. The unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 9.8 percent. Over the first seven months of the year the advance in the index of average hourly earnings was considerably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies, while fluctuating over a wide range, has changed little on balance since late June despite a sharp decline in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates. Demand for dollars appeared to reflect concern about economic and financial difficulties abroad. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in the second quarter was somewhat below the first-quarter deficit, with petroleum imports down substantially.  Ml declined slightly in June and July, while growth of M2 moderated somewhat from its average pace earlier in the year. Business demands for credit, especially short-term credit, remained generally strong. Market interest rates have declined sharply since around midyear, reflecting a shift in market sentiment about the outlook for interest rates against the background of strains in financial markets, relatively weak economic indicators, and legislative action on the federal budget. The Federal Reserve discount rate was reduced in three steps from 12 percent to 10-1/2 percent during the period.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce  inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern  of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee had agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee began a review of these ranges at its meeting on June 30 - July 1, and at a meeting on July 15, it reaffirmed the targets for the year set in February. At the same time the Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic un certainties. The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  In the short run, the Committee continues to seek behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from June to September at annual rates of about 5 percent and about 9 percent respectively. Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable depending on evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to exceptional liquidity demands and changes in financial asset holdings.

Black and Ford and Mrs. Horn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP changed little in the third quarter, following a small increase in the second quarter, while prices on the average continued to rise more slowly than in 1981. In August the nominal value of retail sales fell back to the sharply reduced June level, while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment also declined. Housing starts fell, re versing much of the substantial July increase. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.8 percent in August, but claims for unemployment insurance have risen further in recent weeks and there are indications of some further decline in production. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained considerably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen strongly further over the past month, reflecting in part a continuing concern in the market about economic and financial difficulties abroad and also some firming of U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates after a considerable drop earlier. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit rose sharply in August and on average in July and August the deficit rate was well above that for the first half.  After three months of weakness, M1 grew rapidly in August and September; growth in M2 accelerated in August from an already rapid pace but appears to have slowed markedly in September. Following large declines over the preceding two months, short-term market interest rates have risen somewhat on balance since late August, while bond yields and mortgage rates have continued to decline. The Federal Reserve discount rate was reduced  from 10-1/2 percent to 10 percent in late August. Mean while, reflecting some well-publicized problems in recent months of a few banks here and abroad and the financing difficulties of Mexico, a more cautious atmosphere in private credit markets has been reflected in wider spreads between U.S. government and some private credit instruments.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties. The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of the year is subject to unusually great uncertainties because it will be substantially affected by special circumstances -- in the very near term by reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and later by the public's response to the new account directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation. The probable difficulties in interpretation of M1 during the period suggest much less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the current quarter. These developments are expected to affect M2 and other broader aggregates to a much smaller extent.  In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit, consistent with growth of M2 (and M3) in a range of around 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate from September to December, and taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets in the light of current economic conditions. Somewhat slower growth, bringing those aggregates around the upper part of the ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 10-1/2 percent.",198210,1,187,1982-10-31,-0.68,-0.86,-0.02,-0.44,-2.0,-1.61,-0.7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1982-10-05

In October the nominal value of retail sales edged up, but was little higher than in the second and third quarters; industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline; and the unemployment rate rose another 0.3 percentage point to 10.4 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained exceptionally high. In September and the third quarter as a whole, housing starts had strengthened. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained consider ably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to appreciate from the  end of September to mid-November. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the third quarter was more than double the rate in the first two quarters of the year.  Growth of M1, already rapid in August and September, accelerated sharply in October in association with the maturing of a large volume of all savers certificates.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up from.sluggish rates in September, but remained below the brisk pace of earlier in the year. Most short-term market interest rates have declined on balance since early October, after a reversal in September, and bond yields and mortgage rates have declined further. On October 8 the Federal Reserve announced a reduction in the discount rate from 10 percent to 9-1/2 percent. Quality spreads in the money markets, which had widened, have narrowed in recent weeks as interest rates have declined, and common stock prices have advanced sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties. The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of the year remains subject to substantial uncertainty because of special circumstances in connection with the reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and the public's response to the new account directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation. The difficulties in interpretation of M1 continue to suggest that much less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the current quarter.  In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit, consistent with growth of M2 (and M3) of around 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate from September to December. Somewhat slower growth, bringing those aggregates around the upper part of the ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198211,1,188,1982-11-30,-0.44,-0.51,0.07,-0.2,-1.08,-1.41,-0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1982-11-16

Black and Ford dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP declined in the fourth quarter, although final sales apparently were maintained, and that the rise in prices remained much less rapid than in 1981. Retail sales and housing activity have strengthened in recent months, but business fixed investment apparently has weakened further and efforts to reduce inventories have continued. In November industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment declined further, and the unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage point to 10.8 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, although down from the early autumn peaks, have remained relatively high. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has slowed appreciably further.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined from peaks reached  in early November. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit rose sharply further in October.  Growth of M1 has remained rapid in recent months, while growth of M2 and M3 has continued at about or somewhat below the rates of earlier in the year. On balance short-term market interest rates have declined since mid-November, while bond yields have risen somewhat in response to unusually heavy borrowing by businesses and governments; mortgage rates have edged down further. The Federal Reserve announced reductions in the discount rate from 9-1/2 percent to 9 percent on November 19 and to 8-1/2 percent on December 13.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertain ties. The Committee had also earlier indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983, but it will review that decision carefully at its February 1983 meeting in light of economic developments and institutional changes associated with the new deposit accounts authorized by the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the months ahead remains subject to substantial uncertainty because of special circumstances in connection with the public's response to the new deposit accounts available at depository institutions. The difficulties in interpretation of M1 continue to suggest that much less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the coming quarter. The institutional changes also add a degree of uncertainty to the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates.   In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves consistent with growth of M2 of around 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate, and of M3 at about an 8 percent rate, from December to March, allowing in the case of M2 for modest shifting into the new money market accounts from large-denomination CD's or market instruments. The Committee indicated that greater growth would be acceptable if analysis of incoming data and other evidence from bank and market reports indicate that the new money market accounts are generating more substantial shifts of funds into broader aggregates from market instruments. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198212,0,189,1982-12-31,-0.45,-0.17,-0.01,-0.17,-0.81,-1.3,-0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1982-12-21

Final sales increased appreciably, and the rise in prices remained much less rapid than in 1981. Retail sales and housing activity have strengthened in recent months, but business fixed investment has weakened further. Nonfarm payroll employment rose in January, after an extended period of declines, and the civilian unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage point to 10.4 percent. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has slowed further.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies depreciated moderately further from mid-December to mid-January, but a subsequent appreciation has more than offset that decline. In the fourth quarter the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was close to the relatively high third-quarter rate.  Growth of M2 surged to an extraordinary pace in January, apparently reflecting shifts of funds into recently authorized money market deposit accounts. Growth of M3 accelerated, following very slow expansion in December. Growth of M1 remained rapid in January, although it was down appreciably from the average pace in other recent months. Market interest rates on U.S. Treasury obligations have risen somewhat since the latter part of December, while rates on most private market instruments are about unchanged to slightly higher. Mortgage rates have declined further.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In establishing growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives, the Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the current impact of new deposit accounts on growth rates of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. A substantial shift of funds into M2 from market instruments, including large certificates of deposit not included in M2, in association with the extraordinarily rapid build-up of money market deposit accounts has distorted growth in that aggregate during the current quarter.  In establishing growth ranges for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts has subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoring M1. Those growth ranges will be reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the light of evidence at that time.  With these understandings, the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appears to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent has been established for M1, assuming that Super NOW accounts draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances is not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt has been estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would be placed on behavior of the broader monetary aggregates, expecting that current distortions in M2 from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will abate. The behavior of M1 will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates to or below the paths implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions relating to the introduction of new accounts. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198302,0,191,1983-02-28,-0.31,-0.26,0.04,-0.21,-0.73,0.01,-0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1983-02-09

Private final sales apparently increased only slightly less than in the fourth quarter with housing activity strengthening further. Business fixed investment has remained weak. Nonfarm payroll employment rose on balance in January and February, after an extended period of declines; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 10.4 percent. In early 1983 the rise in average prices and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings have slowed further.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose somewhat on balance between early February and late March. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined marginally in January.  M2 continued to grow at an exceptional rate in February and M3 also expanded at a rapid pace, but growth in both of the broader aggregates appears to be decelerating substantially in March. The deceleration reflects in part the marked slowing in growth of money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) in recent weeks and apparently also a moderation in the underlying growth of these aggregates, abstracting from shifts from market instruments. M1 has expanded rapidly since late January, largely reflecting accelerated growth in NOW accounts. Growth in debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have been moderate in the first quarter. Short-term interest rates have risen somewhat since early February while long-term rates, including mortgage rates, have declined.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions. At its meeting in February the Committee established growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the current impact of new deposit accounts on growth rates of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. A substantial shift of funds into M2 from market instruments, including large certificates of deposit not included in M2, in association with the extraordinarily rapid build-up of money market deposit accounts, has distorted growth in that aggregate during the first quarter.  In establishing growth ranges for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts has subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoring M1. Those growth ranges  will be reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the light of evidence at that time.  With these understandings, the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from February March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 per cent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appeared to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for M1, assuming that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances is not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would be placed on behavior of the broader monetary aggregates, expecting that distortions in M2 from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will abate.

Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  For the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain generally the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, anticipating that would be consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about 9 and 8 percent, respectively.  The Committee expects that M1 growth at an annual rate of about 6 to 7 percent would be consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges (taking account of the distortions relating to the introduction of new accounts), or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198303,0,192,1983-03-31,0.36,0.2,0.17,0.19,0.92,0.59,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1983-03-29

Industrial production increased sharply in April after rising at a moderate pace in previous months; nonfarm payroll employment and retail sales rose considerably in March and April. Housing starts declined somewhat in both months but were still well above depressed 1982 levels. Data on new orders and shipments suggest that the demand for business equipment is reviving. The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 10.2 percent in April. Average prices have changed little and the index of average hourly earnings has risen at a much reduced pace in the early months of 1983.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has remained in a narrow range near its recent high level since late March. The U.S. foreign trade deficit fell substantially in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in the value of oil imports.  Growth in M2 and M3 decelerated further in April to relatively low rates but appears to have picked up recently.  Ml declined in April but has strengthened markedly in early May. Growth in debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have been moderate over the first four months of the year. Interest rates have changed little on balance since late March.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in February the Committee established growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth ranges of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. A substantial shift of funds into M2 from market instruments, including large certificates of deposit not included in M2, in association with the extraordinarily rapid build-up of money market deposit accounts, distorted growth in that aggregate during the first quarter.  In establishing growth ranges for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts had subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoring M1. Those growth ranges were to be reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the light of evidence at that time. The Committee reviewed the ranges at this meeting and decided not to change them at this time, pending further review at the July meeting. With these understandings, the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appeared to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for M1, assuming that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances was not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on behavior of the broader monetary aggregates expecting that distortions in M2 from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will abate. The behavior of M1 will continue to be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to increase only slightly the degree of reserve restraint. The action was taken against the background of M2 and M3 remaining slightly below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent, respectively, established earlier for the quarter and within their long term ranges, M1 growing well above anticipated levels for some time, and evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery. Lesser restraint would be appropriate in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the broader monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges and deceleration of M1, or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198305,0,194,1983-05-31,0.47,0.45,0.13,0.3,1.34,1.09,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1983-05-24

Expenditures on consumption and housing expanded substantially in the second quarter and businesses apparently began to add to inventories after a period of sharp liquidation. Nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably in May and June and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 10.0 percent in June. Industrial production continued to rise markedly in May and partial data suggest a sizable gain in June. Data on new orders and shipments continued to indicate improvement in the demand for business equipment. In May housing starts increased substantially following small declines earlier and retail sales rose appreciably further. Average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen at a reduced pace in the first five months of 1983.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose substantially in late May and the first half of June and subsequently has fluctuated in a narrow range. Reflecting the strength of the U.S. economy and the persistent high level of the dollar, the U.S. foreign trade deficit increased sharply in April-May from its reduced first-quarter rate; exports declined and both oil and nonoil imports rose.  Strong growth in the broader aggregates in May and June raised M2 to a level somewhat above the mid point of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 to around the upper limit of its range. M1 grew very rapidly over both months and was well above its range for the year. Growth in debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have picked up in the second quarter. Interest rates have risen appreciably since early May.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in February the Committee established growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth ranges of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity.  In establishing growth ranges last February for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts had subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoringM1. With these understandings,the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appeared to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for M1 assuming that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances was not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent. These  ranges were reviewed at the May meeting and left unchanged, pending further review in July.  At this meeting, the Committee reaffirmed the longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth in M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic non financial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly further the existing degree of reserve restraint.  The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8-1/2 and 8 percent respectively from June to September, consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year.  Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Committee anticipates that a deceleration in M1 growth to an annual rate of around 7 percent from June to September will be consistent with  its third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the range established for the year. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198307,0,196,1983-07-31,0.81,0.86,0.12,0.02,1.81,1.6,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1983-07-13

Industrial production increased sharply in July following large gains in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment also rose substantially further in July and the civilian unemployment rate declined 1/2 percentage point to 9.5 percent. After rising sharply in the spring, retail sales have leveled off recently. Housing starts edged down over the past two months but permits continued to rise. Recent data on new orders and shipments on average continued to indicate strength in the demand for business equipment. In July, information on producer and consumer prices and the index of average hourly earnings was consistent with earlier indications of a considerable moderation in the rate of inflation.  Growth in the broader monetary aggregates slowed substantially in July, bringing M2 to a level near the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 to a level somewhat below the upper limit of its range. Growth in M1 decelerated considerably from.its May June pace, but its level remained above the Committee's monitoring range for the year. Interest rates rose appreciably through much of the intermeeting period but recently market rates have retraced most of their rise.  In part reflecting the course of U.S. interest rates, the weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose substantially further in July and early August, but the rise was followed by a subsequent decline that reversed most of the earlier increase. The U.S. foreign trade deficit was smaller in June than in May, but the deficit in the second quarter was much larger than in the first as imports rose while exports were essentially unchanged.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July the Committee reconsidered the growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates established earlier for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives and set tentative ranges for 1984.

Against this background, the Committee at its July meeting reaffirmed the following growth ranges for the broader aggregates: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth in Ml in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was re affirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates.

Industrial production and employment increased appreciably further in August, following large gains in previous months, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 9.5 percent. After rising sharply in the spring, growth in consumer spending has moderated substantially. Housing starts rose in August but permits turned down. Data on new orders and shipments generally continued to indicate strength in the demand for business equipment. Producer and consumer prices increased somewhat more in August than in other recent months, but over the first eight months of the year average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1982.  After slowing substantially in July, growth in M2 remained at a reduced pace over the August-September period, while expansion in M3 picked up. Through September M2 is estimated to be at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 in the upper portion of its range. Growth in M1 decelerated considerably further in August-September and moved within the Committee's monitoring range for the second half of the year. Interest rates have declined somewhat since mid-August.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar, as measured by its weighted average value against major foreign currencies, has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range since mid-August. The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose substantially in July-August from the second-quarter rate, reflecting a further increase in imports of a broad range of goods.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July the Committee reconsidered the growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates established earlier for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives and set tentative ranges for 1984. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have become less predictable; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth of the  monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts may be reflected in some changes in the historical  trends in velocity.  Against this background, the Committee at its July meeting reaffirmed the following growth ranges for the broader aggregates: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth in M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the slightly lesser degree of reserve restraint sought in recent weeks. The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 8-1/2 percent from September to December, consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year. Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 7 percent from September to December will be consistent with its fourth-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the range established for the year.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198310,0,199,1983-10-31,0.46,0.57,0.14,0.29,1.46,1.51,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1983-10-04

In October, industrial production increased appreciably, following large gains in previous months. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further and the civilian unemployment rate declined 1/2 percentage point to 8.8 percent. After changing little on balance during the summer months, retail sales strengthened in September and October. Housing starts and permits declined in September while home sales rose somewhat. Recent data on new orders and shipments indicate further strength in the demand for business equipment. Producer and consumer prices have continued to increase at about the same pace as in other recent months. The index of average hourly earnings rose somewhat more in September and October than in previous months but over the first ten months of the year the index has risen more slowly than in 1982.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen since early October against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies. The U.S. foreign trade deficit increased considerably in the third quarter, with imports, especially of petroleum, rising faster than exports.  After slowing substantially over the summer months, growth in M2 accelerated in October, while M3 continued to expand at a moderate rate. Through October M2 was at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 in the upper portion of its range. M1 continued to grow at a sluggish pace in October and was in the lower portion of the Committee's monitoring range for the second half of the year. Longer-term market rates have risen somewhat on balance since early October, and short-term rates generally have fluctuated in a narrow range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July the Committee reconsidered the growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates established earlier for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives and set tentative ranges for 1984. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have become less predictable; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth of the monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity.  Against this background, the Committee at its July meeting reaffirmed the following growth ranges for the broader aggregates: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth of M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic non financial debt will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 8-1/2 percent from September to December, consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year. Depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly; lesser restraint might be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current expectations. Given the relatively slow growth in October, the Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 5 to 6 percent from September to December will be consistent with its fourth-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the range established for the year.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198311,0,200,1983-11-30,0.24,0.64,0.09,0.24,1.22,1.8,0.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1983-11-15

In November, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further and the civilian unemployment rate declined 0.4 percentage point to 8.4 percent. Retail sales rose substantially in November following sizable gains in September and October. Housing starts increased in November to a level close to their third-quarter average. Recent data indicate continuing expansion in business capital spending. Producer prices were little changed on average in October and November, and consumer prices continued to increase in October at about the same pace as in other recent months. The index of average hourly earnings changed little in November after rising somewhat faster in September and October than in previous months; over the first eleven months of the year the index has risen more slowly than in 1982.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen considerably further since mid-November against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies. In October the U.S. foreign trade deficit was markedly higher than in the third quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in imports.  After slowing substantially over the summer months, growth in M2 and M3 strengthened in October and November. Ml continued to grow at a sluggish pace in November but increased substantially in early December. Through  November, M2 was at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983, M3 was close to the upper limit of its range, and M1 was near the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for the second half  of the year.

The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth of M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates.

The Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 6 percent from November to March will be consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic non financial debt would continue at around its recent pace. Depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly.

In December, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased somewhat further and the civilian unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point to 8.2 percent. Retail sales were reported to have changed little in December following sizable gains in preceding months. Housing starts declined in December but for the fourth quarter as a whole were close to their average for the year. Recent data indicate substantial strength in business capital spending. Producer prices were about unchanged on average in November and December, and consumer prices increased at about the moderate  pace recorded for the year as a whole. The index of average hourly earnings rose somewhat faster in the fourth quarter than in the previous quarter, but for the year 1983 the index increased more slowly than in 1982.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has appreciated somewhat further since the latter part of December, with most of the rise occurring in early January. In the fourth quarter the U.S. foreign trade deficit was markedly higher than in the third quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in non-oil imports.  M2 and M3 have expanded at moderate rates over the past two months. Expansion in M1 apparently accelerated in January, following several months of reduced growth. By the fourth quarter M2 was at a level close to the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1983, M3 was around the upper limit of its range, and M1 was around the middle of the Committee's monitoring range for the second half of the year. Most interest rates have declined somewhat since the latter part of December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pending further experience, growth in that aggregate will need to be interpreted in the light of the growth in the other monetary aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive substantial weight. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on bank reserve positions, anticipating that approach will be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 each at annual rates of about 8 percent and M1 at an annual rate of about 7 percent during the period from December to March. Growth in nonfinancial debt is expected to be within the range established for the year. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a shortfall in monetary and credit growth from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable with more rapid expansion of the aggregates, both viewed in the context of the strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures.  In implementing policy in the weeks ahead, the Manager was instructed to take account of the uncertainties associated with the introduction of the system of more con temporaneous reserve requirements, particularly including the possibility that depository institutions, during a transition period, may desire to hold more excess reserves.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198401,0,202,1984-01-31,0.95,0.71,0.17,0.16,2.0,1.56,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1984-01-31

In January and February, industrial production rose at a considerably faster pace than in the fourth quarter, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were large over the two-month period. The civilian unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point each month to 7.8 percent in February. Retail sales grew at an exceptional pace in January and changed little in February. Housing starts rose substantially in both months to the highest rate in several years. Information on outlays and spending plans generally suggests continuing strength in business fixed investment. Prices rose somewhat faster in early 1984 than in the fourth quarter, with increases concentrated in the food sector. The index of average hourly earnings rose only slightly over the first two months of the year, although total compensation costs appear to have increased more rapidly.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies declined considerably from the end of January through the first week of March, but part of that decline was retraced more recently. The merchandise trade deficit rose sharply in January, mainly because of larger non-oil imports.  Data available through mid-March indicate that M1 and M3 have expanded somewhat more rapidly than anticipated at the previous meeting; since the fourth of 1983, M1 and M3 are tentatively estimated to grown at rates close to the upper limits of the Committee's ranges for 1984. Growth in M2 appears to have been less rapid than previously expected and was estimated to be at a rate in the lower part of its longer-run range. In January and February, growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently rose  at a pace substantially above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, and bank credit continued to expand at a relatively rapid rate. Interest rates have risen considerably since late January.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of Ml, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pending further experience, growth in that aggregate will need to be interpreted in the light of the growth in the other monetary aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive substantial weight. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain pressures on bank reserve positions judged to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent, respectively, during the period from March to June. Greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly; in either case, such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures and the rate of credit growth.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.",198403,0,204,1984-03-31,0.24,0.3,0.08,0.15,0.78,1.35,0.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1984-03-27

In April, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially following decreased growth in March; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.8 per cent in March and April as the labor force increased appreciably. Retail sales grew rapidly in April after two months of decline, and housing starts recovered to a rate equaling their first-quarter average. Information on outlays and spending plans generally suggests continuing strength in business fixed investment. Since the beginning of the year, prices and wages have continued to rise at about the same pace as in 1983.  Ml changed little in April on average, but data available for early May suggest a considerable strengthening. In April M2 grew about in line with expectations while M3 expanded more rapidly than anticipated. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through April, M1 grew at a rate a little below the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1984; M2 increased at a rate in the lower part of its longer-run range, while M3 expanded at a rate a bit above the upper limit of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently is growing at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, with borrowing by businesses continuing to be concentrated in the short-term markets. Interest rates have risen considerably further since late March. On April 6, the Federal Reserve announced an increase in the discount rate from 8-1/2 to 9 percent. Recently, day-to-day market conditions have reflected considerable sensitivity to potential liquidity strains, as highlighted by problems of one large bank, and to uncertainties about the financial and budgetary outlook generally.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has risen considerably further since late March to a level close to the peak in early January. The merchandise trade deficit widened further in the first quarter, as a sharp rise in non-oil imports offset a substantial rise in exports.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting.

Somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly.

In May and June, industrial production and retail sales expanded further, though at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in both months and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in June. Housing starts declined in May to a rate appreciably below the average in the first four months of 1984. Information on outlays and spending plans continues to suggest strength in business fixed in vestment. Since the beginning of the year, average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1983.  M1 grew rapidly in May and June after having changed little in April, while M2 continued to expand moderately. M3 growth slowed somewhat in June but was relatively strong over the second quarter. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through June, M1 grew at a rate somewhat below the upper limit of the Committee's range for 1984; M2 increased at a rate a little below the midpoint of its longer-run range, while M3 expanded at a rate above the upper limit of its range. Total domestic non financial debt continued to grow in the second quarter at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing along with strong private credit growth. Interest rates have fluctuated considerably since the May meeting of the Committee. Financial markets were affected by concerns arising from international debt problems. On balance, rates on private short-term securities rose further, while rates on Treasury bills were about unchanged; in long-term debt markets, rates on most private obligations changed little while those on Treasury bonds declined.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has risen considerably further since mid-May to a level above its peak in early January. The merchandise trade deficit rose further in April-May compared with the first quarter; an increase in oil and non-oil imports exceeded a slight rise in exports.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4to8percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 5-1/2, 7-1/2, and 9 percent respectively during the period from June to September. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly. In either case, such a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 8 to 12 percent.",198407,0,208,1984-07-31,0.13,0.16,-0.03,0.02,0.28,0.73,0.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1984-07-17

In July, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose further, but retail sales fell after rising considerably in earlier months and housing starts declined to a rate appreciably below the average in the second quarter. The civilian un employment rate increased 0.4 percentage point to 7.5 percent. Information on outlays and spending plans continues to suggest strength in business fixed investment. Since the beginning of the year, average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1983.  In July, M1 declined after two months of rapid growth, though data for early August suggested some rebound, while M2 expanded at a relatively slow pace. M3 growth, however, remained comparatively sizable.  From the fourth quarter of 1983 through July, M1 grew at a rate a bit above the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1984; M2 increased at a rate a little below the midpoint of its longer-run range, while M3 expanded at a rate above the upper limit of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing along with strong private credit growth.  Most interest rates have fallen considerably since the July meeting of the Committee, with the largest declines generally in intermediate and long-term bond markets.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies rose further to a new high in early August and since then has fluctuated in a range just below the peak. The merchandise trade deficit in June was somewhat above the May level, and for the second quarter as a whole the deficit was little changed from the high first-quarter rate.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic non financial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.   In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate of around 5 percent or slightly less, and in M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 7-1/2 and 9 percent respectively during the period from June to September. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth. In either case, such a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is  likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 8 to 12 percent.",198408,0,209,1984-08-31,-0.04,0.04,0.04,0.03,0.07,0.44,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1984-08-21

Martin and Rice and Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity slowed appreciably in the third quarter from a strong pace earlier in the year. In August, industrial production rose only slightly and gains in nonfarm payroll employment moderated further; retail sales and housing starts declined for the second month in a row. The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in August at 7.5 percent. Information on outlays and spending plans suggests slower expansion in business fixed investment, following exceptionally rapid growth in recent quarters. Since the beginning of the year, average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1983.  In August the monetary aggregates expanded at relatively slow rates, but data available for September suggested some strengthening. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through September, M1 apparently grew at a rate close to the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1984, M2 at a rate somewhat below the midpoint of its longer-run range, and M3 at a rate near the upper limit of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting large government borrowing along with relatively strong private credit growth. Interest rates generally have fallen somewhat further since the August meeting of the Committee.  Over the past month, the foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has fluctuated widely under often volatile market conditions, reaching a new high in the latter part of September; since then the dollar has declined somewhat. The merchandise trade deficit rose sharply to a record high rate in the July-August period.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase  at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 6 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain the lesser degree of restraint on reserve positions sought in recent weeks. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6, 7-1/2, and 9 percent, respectively, during the period from September to December. A somewhat further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in relation to the strength of business expansion and inflationary pressures, domestic and international financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth. Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of significant strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 8 to 12 percent.",198410,0,211,1984-10-31,-0.02,0.21,0.0,0.07,0.26,0.14,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1984-10-02

Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially outside of manufacturing in October, following a moderate increase in September, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.4 percent. Industrial production fell in September, partly because of strikes, and available information suggests little increase in October. Retail sales and housing starts rebounded in September after two months of decline. Information on outlays and spending plans suggests slower expansion in business fixed investment, following exceptionally rapid growth earlier, and inventory investment, having risen relative to sales in recent months, also appears to be slowing. Since the beginning of the year, broad measures of prices generally have continued to rise at rates close to, or somewhat above, those recorded in 1983, and the index of average hourly earnings has risen somewhat more slowly.  Growth of the monetary aggregates strengthened in September, but data available for October indicated that M1 declined during the month, growth of M2 slowed somewhat, and expansion of M3 picked up further. From  the fourth quarter of 1983 through October, M1 grew at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's range for 1984, M2 at a rate somewhat below the midpoint of its longer-run range, and M3 at a rate a bit above the upper limit of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting large government borrowing; private credit growth, though relatively strong, has moderated in recent months. Interest rates have fallen substantially further since the meeting of the Committee on  October 2.  Over the past month, the foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has continued to fluctuate widely, rising to a new high in mid-October but subsequently declining to somewhat below its level at the time of the previous meeting. The merchandise trade deficit in the third quarter was substantially above the first-half rate as a sharp rise in non-oil imports exceeded some further growth in exports.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions.  In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984.  The associated range for total domestic non financial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate bench marks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluations of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to reduce somewhat existing pressures on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 7-1/2 and 9 percent during the period from September to December. M1 is expected to grow over the period at an annual rate of around 3 percent, less than anticipated earlier in view of the decline in October. In light of that decline, more rapid growth of M1 would be acceptable. Lesser restraint on reserve positions would be sought in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in relation to the strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures, domestic and international financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth. Conversely, greater restraint might be accept able in the event of substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of significant strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures.

Gramley and Solomon dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates a mixed pattern of developments but on balance suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand in the current quarter at a rate approximating the considerably reduced pace recorded in the third quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further outside of manufacturing in November, and the civilian unemployment rate fell from 7.4 to 7.2 percent. After two months of decline industrial production increased somewhat in November, largely reflect ing a rebound in auto production from strike-reduced levels. Retail sales registered a large gain in November after changing little in October. Information on outlays suggests substantially slower expansion in business fixed investment, following exceptionally rapid growth earlier. Since the beginning of the year, broad measures of prices generally have continued to rise at rates close to, or somewhat above, those recorded in 1983, and the index of average hourly earnings has risen somewhat more slowly.  Growth of the monetary aggregates strengthened markedly in November. The November expansion in M1 offset the decline in October, and this aggregate.has grown little on balance since early summer; from the fourth quarter of 1983 through November, M1 grew at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's range for 1984. Growth in the broader aggregates was especially rapid in November, bringing M2 to the midpoint of its longer-run range and M3 a bit further above the upper limit of its range. Expansion in total domestic non financial debt is continuing above the Committee's  monitoring range for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing and strong private credit growth.  Interest rates have fallen further since the November meeting of the Committee, with the largest declines concentrated in short-term markets. On November 21, the Federal Reserve approved a reduction in the discount rate from 9 to 8-1/2 percent.  Since early November the foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has appreciated substantially, reversing most of the previous decline from its mid-October peak. The merchandise trade deficit in October was  significantly reduced from the rate in the third quarter, mainly reflecting a sharp decline in non-oil imports.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluations of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to reduce pressures on reserve positions consistent with growth of M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 7, 9, and 9 percent, respectively, during the period from November to March. Somewhat more rapid growth of M1 would be acceptable in light of the currently estimated shortfall in growth for the fourth quarter relative to the Committee's expectations at the beginning of the period, particularly in the context of sluggish growth in economic activity and continued strength of the dollar in exchange markets.

Total retail sales rose in January at about the same pace as the average for November and December, while the decline in housing starts appears to have ended. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably in the November-December period and nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in January. The civilian unemployment rate rose slightly in January to 7.4 percent. Information on business spending suggests less rapid expansion in outlays for fixed investment, following exceptional growth earlier; businesses also appear to have made substantial progress in adjusting their inventories. During 1984 broad measures of prices generally increased at rates close to those recorded in 1983, and the index of average hourly earnings rose somewhat more slowly.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has continued to appreciate strongly since mid-December. After the announcement on January 17 by the G-5 Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors regarding coordinated intervention in exchange markets, and subsequent operations, the dollar's rise moderated somewhat. The merchandise trade deficit declined sharply in December and for the fourth quarter as a whole, primarily because of a large drop in imports from the high rate in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the deficit for the full year 1984 was substantially higher than in 1983.  After growing little on balance since early summer, Ml expanded at a rapid pace in late 1984 and early 1985. The broader aggregates also expanded rapidly in recent months. For the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, M1 grew at a rate of about 5-1/4 percent, somewhat below the midpoint of the Committee's range for the year, and M2 increased at a rate of about 7-3/4 percent, a bit above the midpoint of its longer-run range. Both M3 and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at rates above the Committee's ranges for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing and strong private credit growth, boosted in part by the unusual size of merger-related credit activity. Short-term interest rates have risen somewhat on balance since the December meeting of the Committee, but long-term rates are about unchanged to a little lower. On December 21, the Federal Reserve approved a reduction in the discount rate from 8-1/2 to 8 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, taking account of the progress against inflation, remaining uncertainties in the business outlook, and the strength of the dollar in the exchange markets, the Committee seeks to maintain reserve conditions characteristic of recent weeks. Should growth in M1 appear to be exceeding an annual rate of around 8 percent and M2 and M3 a rate of around 10 to 11 percent during the period from December to March, modest increases in reserve pressures would be sought, particularly if business activity is rising at a satisfactory rate and exchange market pressures diminish. Lesser restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth in the monetary aggregates, particularly in the context of sluggish growth  in economic activity and continued strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the  monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198502,0,215,1985-02-28,-0.09,0.02,0.07,-0.05,-0.04,-0.01,-0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1985-02-13

Total retail sales rose considerably for January and February combined and housing starts, though declining in February, were above their fourth-quarter pace. However, information on business capital spending suggests less rapid expansion in early 1985. Business inventory investment continues at a moderate rate. Industrial production declined on balance in January and February and, with employment falling in the manufacturing sector, total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a somewhat reduced pace. The civilian unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent in February, was  little changed from its level at measures of prices and the index earnings appear to be continuing close to those recorded in 1984.  year-end. Broad of average hourly to rise at rates  Since the Committee's meeting in mid-February, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has fluctuated widely in often volatile market conditions. Most recently, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has dropped sharply, more than offsetting its rise earlier in the inter meeting interval. Monetary authorities sold dollars on a large scale during the period, especially in late February and early March. The merchandise trade deficit increased sharply in January from relatively low December and fourth-quarter rates. The current account deficit for the full year 1984 was more than double that recorded in 1983.  Growth in M1 accelerated in February, following relatively rapid expansion in other recent months, but information available through mid-March indicates a considerable slowing. Growth in the broader aggregates moderated in February and appears to be slowing further in March. In January and February expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained relatively rapid, though somewhat below the pace of previous months. Most interest rates have risen somewhat since the February meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting in February to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future progress against inflation, taking account of the uncertainties in the business value of the dollar, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6, 7, and 8 percent respectively during the period from March to June. Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

Total retail sales rose in April to a level somewhat above the average for the first quarter, and housing starts increased further after rising substantially in the first quarter. Information on business capital spending suggests further growth, though at a much less rapid pace than earlier in the economic expansion. Industrial production declined slightly in April after rising little over the first quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a somewhat reduced pace in April with employment in manufacturing registering another decline. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent in April. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  Since the Committee's meeting in late March, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has continued to fluctuate widely in often volatile market conditions and has declined moderately on balance. The trade and current account deficits widened in the first quarter as a rebound in non-oil imports from their low fourth-quarter level extended the pattern of sharp quarter-to-quarter swings experienced since the beginning of 1984.  Growth in M1 slowed markedly in March from the rapid pace of earlier months and remained moderate in April. The broader aggregates showed little change in April after their growth had slowed appreciably in March. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained relatively rapid. Interest rates have declined considerably since the March meeting of the Committee. On May 17, the Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount rate from 8 to 7-1/2 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting at this meeting suggests GNP in the current of growth in the first in February to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, and against the background of the recent reduction in the discount rate, the Committee seeks to maintain about the same degree of pressure on bank reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in Ml at an annual rate of around 6 percent or a little higher during the  period from March to June, while M2 and M3, in the light of their weakness in April, are expected to grow more slowly over the quarter than the 7 and 8 percent annual rates, respectively, anticipated earlier. Somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

Total retail sales rose on balance in April and May to a level appreciably above the average for the first quarter, and housing starts held earlier gains after rising substantially in the first quarter. Information on business capital spending suggests further growth, though at a much less rapid pace than earlier in the economic expansion. Industrial production declined slightly in April and May after rising little over the first quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a somewhat reduced pace in May and June with employment in manufacturing registering further declines. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent in June, unchanged since February. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  Since the Committee's meeting in May, the trade weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has generally moved within a relatively narrow range but recently has declined to a level below its April low. The merchandise trade deficit in April-May widened from the first-quarter rate as both agricultural and non-agricultural exports fell, while imports remained close to their high first-quarter level.  M1 expanded very rapidly in May and June after growing at a moderate pace in the preceding two months.  The broader aggregates also grew more rapidly in May and June after slowing appreciably earlier. From the fourth quarter of 1984 through June, M1 grew at a rate well above the Committee's range for 1985; M2 increased at a rate around the upper end of its longer-run range;  while M3 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt slowed a little in the second quarter but remained high relative to the Committee's monitoring range for the year. Interest rates have declined somewhat further since the May meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at this meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent. With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments including developments in foreign exchange markets. More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic non financial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986. With respect to Ml particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depositor behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 at an annual rate of around 7-1/2 percent during the period from June to September, and with a substantial slowing of M1 growth to an annual rate of 5 to 6 percent. Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198507,0,220,1985-07-31,-0.48,0.01,0.11,-0.04,-0.39,-0.17,-0.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1985-07-10

In July, industrial production continued to move somewhat higher and total retail sales rose modestly after two months of decline. On the other hand, housing starts fell somewhat in July. Information on business capital spending suggests further growth, though at a much less rapid pace than earlier in the economic expansion. Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to increase in July, although employment in manufacturing declined slightly further. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent in July, unchanged since February. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  Since the Committee's meeting in July, the trade weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has depreciated further. The merchandise trade deficit widened in the second quarter to the highest rate on record. Both agricultural and non agricultural exports fell substantially, while imports registered a small increase.  Based on data for July and early August, M1 has been growing relatively rapidly. Demand deposits have shown little change on balance, but other checkable deposits have expanded substantially. Growth in M2 has continued at around the upper end of its 1985 range, while relatively sluggish growth in M3 recently has brought this aggregate to the midpoint of its range. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained high relative to the Committee's monitoring range for the year. Most interest rates have risen somewhat since the July meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at the July meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was re affirmed at 9 to 12 percent. With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments including developments in foreign exchange markets. More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986. With respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depositor behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 8-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent, respectively, during the period from June to September. M1 growth is expected to slow from its recent pace, but given the rapid growth in recent weeks, expansion over the June to September period may be at an 8 to 9 percent annual rate. Somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth in the monetary aggregates. Somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198508,0,221,1985-08-31,0.13,0.16,0.18,0.28,0.74,-0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1985-08-20

In August, industrial production increased somewhat. Total retail sales rose considerably, boosted by a surge in auto sales. Housing starts, while increasing in August, were still no higher than their average level in the second quarter. Incoming information generally suggested a leveling of business capital spending. The merchandise trade deficit in July and August averaged somewhat less than in the second quarter as a drop in imports was partly offset by a slight decline in exports. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose somewhat more in August than in most other recent months. The civilian unemployment rate fell from 7.3 percent in July -- its level since February -- to 7.0 percent in August. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to or somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year.  Following the Committee's meeting on August 20, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies appreciated through mid-September. The dollar subsequently declined sharply, especially after the announcement on September 22 by the Finance Ministers  and Central Bank Governors of the G-5 countries that exchange rates have not fully reflected economic fundamentals.  M1 growth surged in August, reflecting exceptional strength in interest-bearing checkable deposits and relatively rapid expansion in other components; data for the first half of September suggest slower but still substantial expansion. Reflecting the surge in M1, M2 accelerated in August, and M3 also strengthened somewhat. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained relatively rapid. Most market interest rates have changed little on balance since the August meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at the July meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent.  With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments including developments in foreign exchange markets. More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986. With respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depositor behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September to December at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. A marked slowing of Ml growth over the period to an annual rate of around 6 to 7 percent is also anticipated; slower growth over the next three months would be acceptable in the context of satisfactory economic performance, given recent very rapid growth in M1. Somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, taking account of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10  percent.

With Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand at a relatively modest pace. In September, total retail sales rose considerably further, but the gain was boosted by a temporary surge in auto sales that was reversed in October. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in October, following a much  slower advance in September, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.1 percent. In recent months industrial production has increased only slightly on balance. Housing starts fell in September, but sales of new and existing homes remained at a relatively high level on average. Incoming information generally suggests a leveling of business capital spending. Merchandise trade data for the third quarter indicate that the deficit widened slightly, as imports continued to in crease. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to or somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year.  M1 appears to have shown little net change in October following several months of rapid expansion. Largely reflecting the weakness in M1, growth in M2 and M3 apparently was quite moderate in October. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained relatively rapid. Most short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance since the October 1 meeting of the Committee, while long term rates have declined somewhat. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has dropped slightly further on balance since October 1, following a substantial decline after the September 22 meeting of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G-5 countries.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at the July meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent. With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments including developments in foreign exchange markets. More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3.  The associated range for growth in total domestic non financial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986. With respect to Ml particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depository behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks generally to maintain about the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September to December at annual rates of about 6 percent. M1 growth over the period at an annual rate of around 6 percent is also anticipated; slower growth for that aggregate would be acceptable in the context of satisfactory economic performance, given the very rapid growth in M1 over the summer.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased further in November,  though less than in October, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.0 percent. Retail sales and  industrial production picked up in November after declining in October. After strengthening in October, housing starts fell appreciably in November. Incoming information generally suggests relatively sluggish business capital spending. Revised merchandise trade data for the third quarter confirm that the deficit widened further, as non-oil imports continued to increase and exports fell somewhat. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to those recorded earlier in the year.  After declining in October, M1 grew substantially in November while growth in M2 and M3 continued quite moderate. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained rapid. Through November, M1 expanded at a  rate well above the long-run range set by the Committee, M2 grew at a rate a bit below the upper end of its range for the year, and M3 expanded at a rate near the mid point of its range for 1985. Treasury bill rates have fallen somewhat while other short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance since the November meeting of the Committee; long-term rates have moved appreciably lower over the period. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined on balance since the Committee's meeting in early November, though the dollar has tended to stabilize more recently.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at the July meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent. With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments including developments in foreign exchange markets. More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for  M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986. With respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depository behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of about 6 to 8 percent; while the behavior of Ml continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of 7 to 9 percent over the period is anticipated. Somewhat greater reserve restraint might, and somewhat lesser reserve restraint would, be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions  in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",198512,0,225,1985-12-31,0.3,0.07,0.2,-0.13,0.43,0.18,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1985-12-17

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially further in January, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent.  In December industrial production rose further, and available information suggests some additional rise in January. Retail sales increased considerably in December after declining on balance over the previous two months, and housing starts rebounded from their October-November pace. Business capital spending strengthened somewhat in the fourth quarter. Merchandise trade data for the fourth quarter suggest that the deficit widened further from the very high third-quarter level. In late 1985 consumer and producer prices rose somewhat more than earlier, but for the year as a whole broad measures of prices and wages increased at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  With respect to the Committee's ranges for longer term monetary growth, M1 expanded at a rate well above the range set for the second half of 1985; M2 grew at a rate somewhat below the upper end of its range for the year; and M3 expanded at a rate near the midpoint of its range for 1985. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt was above the upper end of its monitoring range for the year. In January growth in M1 and M2 slowed markedly, while growth in M3 picked up as banks issued a substantial volume of large time deposits to support further robust growth in bank credit. Interest rates have fluctuated considerably since the December meeting of the Committee; on balance, short-term interest rates have risen a little while longer-term rates are unchanged to somewhat lower. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on its responsiveness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures. It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1986.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of about 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about 7 percent over the period is anticipated. Somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in February following a large rise in January, but employment in manufacturing fell after four months of gains and industrial production declined. The civilian unemployment rate rose sharply to 7.3 percent. Retail sales were little changed in January and February after rising over the previous two months, while housing starts were well above their pace in late 1985. Business capital spending apparently weakened somewhat in early 1986. The merchandise trade deficit for January appears to have been only slightly smaller than in December; preliminary data for February suggest that exports increased and that the price and quantity of oil imports declined. Largely reflecting declines in energy prices, consumer prices edged down on balance over the first two months of 1986 and producer prices fell substantially.  Growth in M1 picked up considerably over the course of the first quarter, leaving this aggregate by March somewhat above the upper end of its range for the year. On the other hand, growth of M2 was generally sluggish over the past 3 months and was running below its long-run range. Expansion of M3 was moderate during the winter months, with growth around the midpoint of its range for 1986. Interest rates have declined considerably since the February meeting of the Committee. On March 6, the Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount rate from 7-1/2 to 7 percent. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to decline through mid-March but has risen somewhat more recently; on balance the dollar has declined slightly since the February meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern  of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its February meeting to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on its responsive ness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures. It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent  for the year 1986.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March to June at annual rates of about 7 percent; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about 7 to 8 percent over the period is anticipated.

Total nonfarm pay roll employment increased moderately further in April following a considerable rise in the first quarter, but employment in manufacturing fell for the third consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.1 percent. Industrial production and total retail sales turned up in April following earlier declines, while housing starts rose somewhat further from a relatively high level. Weakness in the energy sector has contributed to a slowing of business capital spending. The merchandise trade deficit appears to have decreased somewhat in the first quarter, as the volume and average price of oil imports fell. Largely reflecting declines in energy prices, consumer prices have declined somewhat since late 1985 and producer prices have fallen substantially.  In April M1 continued to grow at a rapid pace, leaving this aggregate above the upper end of its range for the year. Growth of the broader aggregates, especially of M2, strengthened considerably in April, bringing M2 into the  lower part of its long-run range and M3 slightly above the midpoint of its range for 1986. Most short-term interest rates have declined on balance since the April 1 meeting of the Committee, while long-term rates are somewhat higher. On April 18, the Federal Reserve Board approved  a reduction in the discount rate from 7 to 6-1/2 percent. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen somewhat recently but on balance the dollar has declined further since the April meeting, particularly against the Japanese yen.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern  of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its February meeting to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on its responsiveness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures. It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1986.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with a deceleration in money growth over the balance of the quarter. However, in view of the rapid money growth thus far in the quarter and the apparent weakness in velocity, the Committee anticipates faster growth for the monetary aggregates, particularly M1, than expected at the last meeting. M2 and M3 are expected to expand over the period from March to June at annual rates of about 8 to 10 percent. While the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about 12 to 14 percent over the period is now anticipated. If the anticipated slowing in monetary growth does not develop, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the context of a pickup in growth of the economy, taking account of conditions in domestic and international financial markets and the behavior of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the context of a marked slowing  in money growth and pronounced sluggishness in economic performance. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 5 to 9 percent.",198605,0,230,1986-05-31,0.02,-0.03,0.15,-0.32,-0.17,0.05,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1986-05-20

In June total nonfarm payroll employment grew little after accounting for striking workers, with continued weakness in the industrial sector reflected in further declines in employment in manufacturing and mining. The civilian unemployment rate moved down to 7.1 percent from 7.3 percent in May. Industrial production declined in May. Total retail sales were about unchanged during the month, although consumer spending rose considerably for the second quarter as a whole. Housing starts fell somewhat in May from a relatively high level. Weakness in the energy sector has contributed to a slowing of business capital spending. Preliminary data for the U.S. merchandise trade balance in April show a somewhat larger deficit than the rate recorded in the first quarter. Both consumer and producer prices turned up in May but have fallen on balance since late 1985, largely reflecting declines in energy prices.  M1 growth in June, though less than in May, was still rapid; through June, M1 grew at a rate well above the Committee's range for 1986. Growth of M2 slowed somewhat and expansion of M3 remained relatively moderate in June, keeping these two aggregates close to the middle of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above the monitoring range for 1986. Most short-term interest rates have declined on balance since the May 20 meeting of the Committee. Rates on Treasury bonds also have moved lower while rates on private long-term obligations are about unchanged to somewhat higher. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined somewhat on balance since the May meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to re affirm the ranges established in February for growth of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate is subject to substantial uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on the responsiveness of M1 growth to changes in interest rates. In light of these un certainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year, the Committee decided that growth of M1 in excess of the previously established 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 would be acceptable.  Acceptable growth of M1 over the remainder of the year will depend on the behavior of velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and price pressures. Given its  rapid growth in the early part of the year, the Committee recognized that the increase in total domestic non financial debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range of 8 to 11 percent, but felt an increase in that range would provide an inappropriate benchmark for evaluating longer-term trends in that aggregate.  For 1987 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987, of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3. While a range of 3 to 8 percent for M1 in 1987 would appear appropriate in the light of most historical experience, the Committee recognized that the exceptional uncertainties surrounding the behavior of M1 velocity over the more recent period would require careful appraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,.taking account of the possibility of a change in the discount rate. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June to September at annual rates of about 7 to 9 percent. While growth in M1 is expected to moderate from the exceptionally large increase during the second quarter, that growth will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors. Somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next  meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198607,0,232,1986-07-31,0.12,0.25,0.13,0.01,0.52,0.03,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1986-07-09

Melzer and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates a mixed pattern of developments but suggests on balance  that economic activity is expanding moderately in the current quarter. In July total nonfarm payroll employment grew strongly, boosted in part by the return of striking workers. However, continued weakness in the industrial sector was reflected in further declines in employment in manufacturing and mining. The civilian unemployment rate moved down to 6.9 percent from 7.1 percent in June. Industrial production declined slightly further in July. The nominal value of total retail sales was about unchanged during the month, as sales of new autos declined somewhat but spending on other consumer goods remained strong. Housing starts fell somewhat in May and June from a relatively high level earlier in the year. Business capital spending appears to have remained weak, partly reflecting continuing declines in the energy sector. While fluctuations in energy prices have caused some month-to-month volatility, on average prices and  wages are rising more slowly this year than in 1985.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has continued to decline since the July 8-9 meeting of the Committee. The  U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the second quarter appears to have been about unchanged from the first quarter. The value of total exports and of total imports remained about the same in the two quarters, although the value of oil imports continued to fall in the second quarter while that of non-oil imports rose further.  Growth of M2 and especially of M3 picked up in July, lifting expansion of these two aggregates for the year through July well into the upper portion of their respective ranges established by the Committee for 1986. In July M1 continued to grow at a rate close to the very rapid pace of the second quarter. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Short-term interest rates have declined somewhat since the July meeting of the Committee, while most long-term interest rates are about unchanged to slightly lower on balance. On July 10, the Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount rate from 6-1/2 to 6 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986.

In August total nonfarm payroll employment grew considerably further, with employment in manufacturing rising for the first time since January. The civilian unemployment rate edged down further to 6.8 percent. Industrial production rose slightly in July and August after declining on balance during the first half of the year. Consumer spending has remained relatively strong in recent months, with gains in retail sales in August paced by a sharp rise in auto sales. Housing starts in July and August stayed at a relatively high level. Business capital spending appears to have remained sluggish, reflecting weakness in nonresidential construction. A more moderate rate of wage increases has been sustained in recent months, while broad measures of prices have firmed somewhat due to developments in food and energy markets.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies is essentially unchanged on balance since the August 19 meeting of the Committee. Preliminary data for the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July indicate a larger deficit than in previous months.  Growth of M2 and especially of M3 moderated in August, but expansion of these two aggregates for the year through August has been at the upper end of their respective ranges established by the Committee for 1986. In August M1 continued to grow very rapidly. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Short term interest rates have declined further since the August meeting of the Committee while long-term market rates have risen on balance. On August 20, the Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount rate from 6 to 5-1/2 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986.

In light of these un certainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year, the Committee decided that growth of M1 in excess of the previously established 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 would be acceptable. Acceptable growth of M1 over the remainder of the year will depend on the behavior of velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and price pressures.

Slightly greater reserve restaint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.

In September total nonfarm payroll employment grew somewhat further, although employment in manufacturing fell after changing little in August. The civilian unemployment rate moved back up to 7.0 percent in September, close to its average level earlier in the year. Industrial production rose slightly further in September and posted a moderate gain over the third quarter. Consumer spending has remained strong in recent months, with gains in retail sales in August and especially in September paced by a sharp rise in auto sales. Housing starts fell in September, but residential investment increased further in the third quarter as a whole. Business capital spending appears to have remained sluggish; equipment spending picked  up in the third quarter and new orders were strong in September, but outlays for nonresidential construction continued to decline. Real net exports of goods and services dropped further in the third quarter, reflecting in large part a surge in the volume of oil imports. Increases in labor compensation have slowed over the course of the year, while broad measures of prices have firmed somewhat recently due to developments in food and energy markets.  Growth of M2 moderated further in September, but appears to have picked up in October, while growth of M3 has tended to slow. Expansion of these two aggregates for the year through September has been at the upper end of their respective ranges established by the Committee for 1986. Growth of M1 slowed in the September-October period from the very rapid pace experienced since early spring. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Most interest rates have declined somewhat since the September 23 meeting of the Committee. Although the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to decline for several weeks after the September meeting, it subsequently recovered and has risen somewhat on balance.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate is subject to substantial uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on the responsiveness of M1 growth to changes in interest rates. In light of these uncertainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year, the Committee decided that growth of M1 in excess of the previously established 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 would be acceptable. Acceptable growth of M1 over the remainder of the year will depend on the behavior of velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and price pressures. Given its rapid growth in the early part of the year, the Committee recognized that the increase in total domestic non financial debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range of 8 to 11 percent, but felt an increase in that range  would provide an inappropriate benchmark for evaluating longer-term trends in that aggregate.  For 1987 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987, of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3. While a range of 3 to 8 percent for M1 in 1987 would appear appropriate in the light of most historical experience, the Committee recognized that the exceptional uncertainties surrounding the behavior of M1 velocity over the more recent period would require careful appraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September to December at annual rates of 7 to 9 percent. While growth in M1 over the same period is expected to moderate from its exceptional pace during the previous several months, growth in this aggregate will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors. Slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the  Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely  to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198611,0,236,1986-11-30,0.12,0.13,0.0,-0.11,0.14,0.23,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1986-11-05

Total nonfarm payroll employment grew appreciably further in October and November, and employment in manufacturing also rose after declining on balance in previous months. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent in November for the third consecutive month. Industrial production picked up considerably in November. Total retail sales rose moderately last month after changing little on balance over September and October. Housing starts have weakened and business capital spending generally appears to have remained sluggish. Preliminary data for the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October suggest a moderate narrowing. Broad measures of prices have firmed somewhat in recent months due to developments in food and energy markets. Labor cost increases this year have remained moderate compared with other recent years.  Growth of M2 slowed substantially in November, while growth of M3 remained moderate. Expansion of these two aggregates for the year through November has been just below the upper end of their respective ranges established by the Committee for 1986. In November growth of M1 accelerated to a very rapid rate. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Short-term interest rates have risen somewhat since the November 5 meeting of the Committee, while long-term rates have declined on balance. In foreign exchange markets the trade-weighted value of the dollar against other G-10 currencies has declined moderately on balance since the November meeting.

Total nonfarm payroll employment grew sharply in January in part reflecting unusual seasonal developments. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent in January. Industrial production increased considerably in December and over the fourth quarter as a whole. Total retail sales rose substantially in December, largely reflecting a year-end surge in automobile sales, but were little changed on balance in the fourth quarter. Housing starts also strengthened in December after trending lower since late spring. Business capital spending generally appears to have remained sluggish. Available data for the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the fourth quarter suggest a slight increase from the third quarter; however, after allowing for price changes, net exports of goods and services improved somewhat during the quarter. In late 1986 consumer and producer prices generally were continuing to rise at moderate rates, although prices of crude oil and some other industrial commodities firmed. Labor cost increases were more restrained in 1986 than in other recent years.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up substantially in December before slowing a little in January. For 1986 as a whole, expansion of these two aggregates was near the upper end of their respective ranges established by the Committee for the year. Growth of M1 slowed in January from an exceptionally rapid pace in late 1986. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Although short-term interest rates generally firmed around year-end, on balance interest rates have shown small mixed changes since the December 15-16 meeting of the Committee; rates on Treasury securities, including bonds, have risen a little over the period while rates on most private obligations have declined slightly. In foreign exchange markets the trade-weighted value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies has declined substantially on balance since the December meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee established growth ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. During 1987, the Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow. However, in the light of its sensitivity to a variety of influences, the Committee decided not to establish a precise target for its growth over the year as a whole at this time. Instead, the appropriateness of changes in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In that connection, the Committee believes that, particularly in the light of the extraordinary expansion of this aggregate in recent years, much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness of the dollar in exchange markets, and relatively strong growth in the broad monetary aggregates. Conversely, continuing sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated in circumstances characterized by sluggish business activity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price stability, and progress toward international equilibrium. As this implies, the Committee in reaching operational decisions during the year, might target appropriate growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from January through March at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. Growth in M1 is expected to slow substantially from the high rate of earlier months. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198702,0,239,1987-02-28,0.65,0.31,0.33,0.59,1.88,0.69,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1987-02-11

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose strongly again in February. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent for the third consecutive month. Industrial production also increased appreciably further in February. Total retail sales have continued to fluctuate substantially from month to month, largely reflecting the uneven pattern of automobile sales, but on balance overall consumer spending has been relatively flat over the past several months. Housing starts strengthened further in February after rising in December and January to their highest level since late spring. Business capital spending appears to have weakened in early 1987. Consumer and producer prices rose more rapidly in early 1987, primarily reflecting sizable increases in energy prices. Labor cost in creases have remained relatively moderate in recent months.  Growth of M2 and M3 has slowed substantially from the pace in December and January, and for 1987 to date expansion of these two aggregates appears to have been around the lower ends of their respective ranges established by the Committee for the year. Growth of M1,after moderating in January from an exceptionally rapid pace in late 1986, also has slowed markedly further. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated appreciably since year-end. Interest rates generally have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range since the February 10-11 meeting of the Committee, although they have firmed somewhat recently. At a meeting in the latter part of February, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of major industrial countries agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around then-current levels. However, after mid-March, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies declined further on balance, including a sizable decline against the yen.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at its February meeting established growth ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. During 1987, the Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow. However, in the light of its sensitivity to a variety of influences, the Committee decided at the February meeting not to establish a precise target for its growth over the year as a whole. Instead, the appropriateness of changes in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In that connection, the Committee believes that, particularly in the light of the extraordinary expansion of this aggregate in recent years, much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness of the dollar in exchange markets, and relatively strong growth in the broad monetary aggregates. Conversely, continuing sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated in circumstances characterized by sluggish business activity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price stability, and progress toward international equilibrium. As this implies, the Committee in reaching operational decisions during the year, might target appropriate growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on developments in foreign exchange markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in credit markets. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of around 6 percent or less. Growth in M1 is expected to remain substantially below its pace in 1986. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198703,0,240,1987-03-31,-0.03,0.2,0.08,0.03,0.29,0.41,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1987-03-31

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further in April, with most of the gains continuing to be in the service producing sectors. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent from 6.6 percent in March. In April, industrial production declined after increasing at a moderate rate in the first quarter. Total retail sales changed little but were up somewhat from their average level in the first quarter. Housing starts were down somewhat in April from their first-quarter average. Recent indicators of business capital spending point  to some recovery over the near term from a depressed level in the first quarter. Consumer and producer prices have risen more rapidly this year, primarily reflecting sizable increases in prices of energy and non-oil imports. Labor cost increases have remained relatively moderate in recent months.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in April from a sluggish pace in February and March, but for 1987 to date expansion of these two aggregates has been slightly below the lower ends of their respective ranges established by the Committee for the year. M1 surged in April prompted by exceptionally large tax payments. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has moderated somewhat thus far this year. Most interest rates have risen considerably since the March 31 meeting of the Committee, with the largest increases occurring in longer-term markets.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was under heavy downward pressure over most of the intermeeting period and intervention purchases of dollars were substantial. Recently the dollar has tended to stabilize, but on balance its trade-weighted value against the other G-10 currencies declined over the period. In March the merchandise trade deficit was close to the average for January and February.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at its February meeting established growth ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors.

As this implies, the Committee in reaching operational decisions during the year might target appropriate growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the degree of reserve pressure sought in recent weeks, taking into account the possibility of a change in the discount rate. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures and on developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of around 6 percent or less. Growth in M1 is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986.

In May and June, total non farm payroll employment rose modestly further, with most of the gains continuing to be in the service-producing sectors. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in June and was down appreciably from its average level in the first quarter. Industrial production increased substantially in May after rising moderately on balance in earlier months of the year. Consumer spending appears to have increased in the second quarter, but housing starts were down somewhat further in May to a level considerably below their first-quarter average. Recent indicators of business capital spending point to some recovery, particularly in equipment outlays, from a depressed level in the first quarter. In April the  merchandise trade deficit was smaller than in March and below the monthly average for the first quarter. The rise in consumer and producer prices moderated in May but for the year to date prices have risen more rapidly than in 1986, primarily reflecting sizable increases in prices of energy and non-oil imports. Wage increases have remained relatively moderate in recent months.  M2 increased slightly in May and June while growth of M3 remained moderate. For 1987 through June, expansion of M2 has been below the lower end of the range established by the Committee for the year, and growth of M3 around the lower end of its range. Following a surge in April, M1 contracted on balance in May and June. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has  moderated this year.  Most interest rates have declined somewhat on balance since the May 19 meeting of the Committee. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies has risen on balance since the May meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to re affirm the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of the potential for some strengthening in underlying inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity is expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.  For 1988, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the year, the Committee again decided not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range has been set for 1988. The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures. The Committee welcomes substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved with establishing a target for M1 will be.carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures and on developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of around 5 and 7-1/2 percent, respectively. Growth in M1,while picking up from recent levels, is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986.

In July, total nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further;  the increase included continuing large gains in the service-producing sector and a sizable advance in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further to 6.0 percent. Industrial production increased strongly in July after rising moderately on balance in the first half of the year. Consumer spending grew at a reduced pace earlier in the year  but retail sales posted large increases in June and July. Housing starts were unchanged in July and remained at their reduced second-quarter level. Recent indicators of business capital spending point to some strength, particularly in equipment outlays. The rise in consumer and producer prices has been moderate in recent months, but for the year to date prices generally have risen more rapidly than in 1986, primarily reflecting sizable increases in prices of energy and non-oil imports. Wage increases have remained relatively moderate in recent months.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was unchanged on balance since the meeting of the Committee on July 7. In the second quarter the merchandise trade deficit in current dollars was about the same as in the first quarter.  The monetary aggregates grew slowly in July. For 1987 through July, expansion of both M2 and M3 has been below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year, while growth in M1 has been well below its pace in 1986. Expansion in total domestic non financial debt has moderated this year. Most long-term interest rates have risen somewhat since the July meeting; in short-term markets, Treasury bill rates also have increased somewhat while private rates are little changed. Stock prices have risen substantially since the latest meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting in July to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of the potential for some strengthening in under lying inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity is expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.  For 1988, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the year, the Committee again decided at the July meeting not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range was set for 1988. The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the be havior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures. The Committee welcomes substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved with establishing a target for M1 will be carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the aggregates. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of around 5 percent. Growth in M1,while picking up from recent levels, is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198708,0,245,1987-08-31,0.38,0.2,0.13,-0.2,0.52,0.62,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1987-08-18

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose further in August after a large increase in July. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 6.0 percent, well below its level at the start of the year. Indus trial production increased further in August following large gains in other recent months. Consumer spending, bolstered by a rise in auto sales, posted a large increase in August. Recent indicators of business capital spending point to some strength, particularly in equipment outlays. Housing starts fell in August to a level a little below their average in other recent months. Preliminary data suggest that the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was unchanged in July from its June level but larger than the second quarter average. The rise in consumer and producer prices has slowed in recent months, reflecting favor able price developments in food and energy.  Growth of the monetary aggregates strengthened in August, but for 1987 through August, expansion of both M2 and M3 remained below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year; growth in  M1 has been at a much reduced pace in 1987. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has moderated this year. Interest rates have risen considerably since the meeting on August 18. On September 4, the Federal Reserve Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 5-1/2 to 6 percent. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has depreciated on balance  since the latest meeting; some of the decline in the dollar early in the intermeeting period was later reversed.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting in July to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3 measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of the potential for some strengthening in underlying inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity is expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.  For 1988, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth in total domestic non financial debt at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the year, the Committee again decided at the July meeting not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range was set for 1988. The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures. The Committee welcomes substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved with establishing a target for M1 will be carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks. Somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the aggregates. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from August through December at annual rates of around 4 percent and around 6 percent, respectively. M1 is expected to continue to grow relatively slowly. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 5 to 9 percent.",198709,0,246,1987-09-30,0.16,0.21,-0.03,0.3,0.64,0.72,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1987-09-22

Share prices in the stock market were down sharply. Following a particularly large decline of stock prices in mid-October, interest rates fell steeply and increases that had occurred during the first part of the intermeeting period subsequently were more than reversed on most types of debt obligations. Foreign exchange markets were relatively calm over most of the intermeeting period, but the dollar came under significant downward pressure late in the period.  In the third quarter economic activity had expanded at a fairly brisk pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose further in September, with the manufacturing sector continuing to record relatively sizable gains. The  civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.9 percent. Industrial production increased somewhat further in September following large gains in other recent months. Retail sales declined somewhat in September, but consumer spending, bolstered by a rise in auto sales, posted a large increase over the third quarter. Business capital spending was strong in the third quarter and forward indicators pointed to continuing gains. Housing starts were up in September but were little changed in the third quarter from their second-quarter average. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in August, but the July-August average remained above the second-quarter rate. The rise in consumer and producer prices was relatively moderate in recent months following more rapid increases earlier in  the year.  Growth of the monetary aggregates appeared to have strengthened in October, with some of the strength reflecting heightened demands for transaction balances and other liquid assets in the latter part of the month. Even so, for 1987 through October, expansion of M2 evidently moved closer to, but remained below, the lower end of the range established by the Committee for the year, while growth of M3 was around the lower end of its range. Expansion in total domestic non financial debt has remained on a more moderate trend in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis; and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting in July to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3 measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of the potential for some strengthening in underlying inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity is expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.  For 1988, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth in total domestic non financial debt at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  With respect toM1, the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the year, the Committee again decided at the July meeting not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range was set for 1988. The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures. The Committee welcomes substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved with establishing a target for M1 will be carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent days. The Committee recognizes that the volatile conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility in open market operations, depending, in particular, on demands for liquidity growing out of recent or prospective developments in financial markets. Apart from such considerations, somewhat lesser reserve restraint would, or slightly greater reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. While the outlook for monetary growth over the months ahead is subject to unusual uncertainty, the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent, but more rapid growth is possible should preferences for liquidity be particularly strong. Over the same period, growth in M1 is expected to be well above its average pace in the previous several months. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a  federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198711,0,248,1987-11-30,0.24,0.24,0.05,-0.03,0.5,0.8,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1987-11-03

The extent to which those disturbances would  affect the economy remained uncertain. Information available for the current quarter suggested that the expansion in economic activity was moderating from a brisk pace in the third quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose strongly further over October and November, with the manufacturing sector recording relatively large gains. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.9 percent in November, remained close to  its level since mid-year. Industrial production also increased considerably further over October and November, following sizable advances since late spring. Retail sales edged up in November after two months of substantial declines. Recent indicators  of business capital spending suggested modest further growth after a surge in the third quarter. Housing starts rose somewhat in November, after slowing in October, but were little changed from the average pace in the second and third quarters. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October appeared  to have deteriorated substantially from the average rate in the third quarter. The rise in broad measures  of prices and wages in recent months generally has been close to that experienced earlier in the year.  Financial markets remained somewhat unsettled. Stock and bond prices continued to fluctuate over a relatively wide range during the period since the previous Committee meeting on November 3. On balance, share prices fell  somewhat further in this period. Changes in long-term yields were mixed while short-term interest rates rose, especially on short-maturity private market instruments. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined considerably further.  The monetary aggregates weakened in November after strengthening in October in conjunction with a temporary surge in demands for transaction balances and other liquid assets in the latter part of that month. For 1987 through November, expansion of M2 fell somewhat further below the lower end of the range established by the Committee for the year, while growth of M3 remained around the lower end of its range. Growth of M1 was close to that of nominal GNP for the year to date and expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained well within the Committee's monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee agreed at its meeting in July to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3 measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The Committee agreed that growth in these aggregates around the lower ends of their ranges might be appropriate in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of the potential for some strengthening in underlying inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity was expanding at an acceptable pace. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.  For 1988, the Committee agreed in July on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  With respect to M1,the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this sensitivity, which had been reflected in a sharp slowing of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the year, the Committee again decided at the July meeting not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range was set for 1988. The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year would continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures. The Committee welcomed substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater inflationary pressures. The Committee indicated in July that in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year it would take account of growth in M1 in the light of circumstances then prevailing. The issues involved with establishing a target for M1 will be carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The Committee recognizes that still sensitive conditions in financial  markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility in open market operations. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about 5 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Over the same period, growth in M1 is expected to remain relatively limited. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198712,0,249,1987-12-31,0.3,0.21,0.09,0.18,0.77,0.84,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1987-12-16

The growth in output appeared to have slowed around year-end. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose much less in January than on average over the previous three months; the manufacturing sector also recorded reduced employment growth in January. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.8 percent in January, was un changed from December. Growth in industrial production moderated further in December. Retail sales picked up in December, buoyed by improved auto sales, but remained below levels reached during the summer. Indicators of business capital spending were mixed late in the year. Housing starts fell markedly in December, and were down somewhat on balance in the fourth quarter from the average pace in the second and third quarters. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined substantially in November. For October and November combined, the deficit rose slightly from the average rate in the third quarter, but in real terms the deficit was estimated to have narrowed further. The rise in consumer prices slowed and producer prices fell in  late 1987, reflecting declines in energy prices; wage trends have shown little change in recent months.  Most interest rates were down substantially on balance since the Committee's meeting in mid-December. In the Treasury securities market, long-term yields fell consider ably more than short-term rates. Broad indexes of stock prices rose somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period in still relatively volatile trading. The trade weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further in the second half of December but recovered after the turn of the year and has increased moderately on balance since the December meeting.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened substantially in January after slowing over November and December. For 1987 as a whole, expansion of M2 fell considerably below the lower end of the range established by the Committee for the year, while growth of M3 was at the lower end of its range. Growth of M1 surged in January following two months of declines. For the year 1987, M1 growth was marginally below that of nominal GNP, and expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt was at the midpoint of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustain able basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established growth ranges of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic non financial debt was set at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  With respect to M1,the Committee again decided not to establish a specific target for 1988. The behavior of this aggregate in relation to economic activity and prices has become very sensitive to changes in interest rates, among other factors, as evidenced by sharp swings in its velocity in recent years. Consequently, the appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the slightly reduced degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent days. The Committee agrees that the current more normal approach to open market operations remains appropriate; still sensitive conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for some flexibility in operations. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in both M2 and M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.",198802,0,251,1988-02-29,0.15,0.4,0.03,0.22,0.81,0.46,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1988-02-10

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially over the first two months of the year, although employment growth slowed somewhat in the manufacturing sector. The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.7 percent in February. Growth in industrial production moderated in early 1988 from a brisk pace during the second half of 1987. Consumer spending strengthened in January and February, buoyed by higher sales of motor vehicles. Indicators of business capital spending pointed to substantial gains in the first quarter. Housing starts rebounded in February but were still somewhat below the reduced fourth-quarter average. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit changed little in January and was significantly below the fourth-quarter average. In recent months the rise in consumer and producer prices has been relatively modest on balance, reflecting developments in food and energy prices, and wage trends have shown little change.  Most interest rates were up somewhat on balance since the Committee's meeting in February, with the largest increases concentrated in bond markets. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fluctuated in a relatively narrow range over most of the intermeeting period, but declined somewhat in recent days.  After strengthening in January, growth of M2 and M3 remained relatively robust in February and in the  first part of March. Thus far this year expansion of these two aggregates appears to have been in the upper portion of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 has grown moderately on balance since the fourth quarter. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace close to that in 1987.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established growth ranges of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 7 to 11 percent for the year.

Hoskins and Parry dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continuing strong expansion in economic activity and rising levels of resource utilization. In April total nonfarm payroll employment rose further; the increase included sizable growth in the manufacturing sector. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, down appreciably from its level at the start of the year. Growth in industrial production picked up considerably in April from a reduced pace earlier in the year. Retail sales fell appreciably last month but estimates of sales in February and March were revised substantially higher. Indicators of business capital spending point to substantial gains thus far this year, notably for equipment. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the first quarter was substantially smaller than that for the fourth quarter. Consumer and producer prices have risen more rapidly recently following a period of relatively modest increases. Broad measures of labor costs indicate  a substantial advance in the first quarter, in part because of a rise in payroll taxes.  Interest rates have risen somewhat since the Committee's meeting on March 29. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of other G-10 currencies had increased slightly on balance over the intermeeting period prior to May 17 and jumped following release of the March trade data.  M1and M2 grew rapidly in April, owing in part to a buildup in transaction balances associated with tax payments, while M3 expanded at a slower pace than in previous months. Through April, expansion of M2 and M3 was in the upper portion of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace close to that in 1987.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established growth ranges of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  With respect to M1,the Committee decided in February not to establish a specific target for 1988. The behavior of this aggregate in relation to economic activity and prices has become very sensitive to changes in interest rates, among other factors, as evidenced by sharp swings in its velocity in recent years. Consequently, the appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the initial implementation of policy, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, and the behavior of the monetary aggregates, the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions would be appropriate in the weeks ahead. Depending on further developments in these factors, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, also be acceptable later in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 5 to 9 percent.  With Messrs. Angell and Kelley and Ms. Seger dissenting from the operational paragraph on policy implementation in the period immediately ahead, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a fairly vigorous pace. Growth in total nonfarm payroll employment moderated somewhat April and May. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in May, a level just below its average in the first quarter. Industrial production advanced considerably in April and May. Retail sales were little changed on balance over the two months after rising appreciably in the first quarter. Available data indicate that business capital spending has remained at the high level reached in the first quarter. Housing starts fell sharply in May, but other indicators suggested little change in the pace of recent housing activity. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined substantially in April, as imports dropped sharply and exports were essentially unchanged. Most measures indicate that prices and wages have risen somewhat more rapidly in recent months. Prices of a broad range of commodities, particularly agricultural goods, have increased sharply in the past few weeks.  Short-term interest rates have risen since the Committee's meeting on May 17, while bond yields have moved lower. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated considerably over the intermeeting period.  Expansion of M2 and M3 slowed considerably in May and M1 was about unchanged, but data available for June suggested some pickup in monetary growth.  From a fourth-quarter base, M2 and M3 have grown at rates in the upper portion of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below that in 1987.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was also maintained at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  For 1989, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989, of 3 to 7 percent for M2 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee set the associated monitoring range for growth in total domestic non financial debt at 6-1/2to10-1/2percent. It was understood that all these ranges were provisional and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the light of intervening developments.  With respect to M1, the Committee reaffirmed its decision in February not to establish a specific target for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, and the behavior of the monetary aggregates, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be accept able in the intermeeting period.

Total nonfarm payroll employment grew sharply further in June and July. The civilian un employment rate in July, at 5.4 percent, was slightly below its average level in the second quarter. Industrial production advanced considerably further in July. Growth in retail sales remained moderate last month. Business capital spending has continued to grow rapidly. Some measures of prices indicate a pickup from recent trends and labor costs have risen more rapidly in recent months.  Most interest rates have increased appreciably since the Committee's meeting on June 29-30. OnAugust 9 the Federal Reserve Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 6 to 6-1/2 percent.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit fell in the second quarter as exports continued to rise and non oil imports declined. Over the intermeeting period, the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated somewhat further in terms of the other G-10 currencies.  Expansion of M2 and to a lesser extent M3 slowed in July but growth of M1 remained relatively strong. From a fourth-quarter base through July, M2 and M3 have grown at rates somewhat above the midpoints of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below that in 1987.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in late June reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was also maintained at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  For 1989, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989, of 3 to 7 percent for M2 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M3. TheCommittee set the associated monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  It was understood that all these ranges were provisional and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the light of intervening developments.  With respect to M1,the Committee reaffirmed its decision in February not to establish a specific target for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate will continue  to be evaluated in the light of movements in its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of about 3-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent, respectively.

Total nonfarm payroll employment grew more slowly in July and August, though the increases in the two months were still sizable. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production advanced slightly further in August after a sharp increase in July. Retail sales were flat in July and August. Recent indicators of business capital spending suggest some moderation from the especially rapid growth in earlier months of the year. Preliminary data for the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July showed some further reduction from the improved second-quarter rate. The latest information on prices suggests little if any change from recent trends.  Most interest rates have declined somewhat since the Committee meeting on August 16. Over the inter meeting period, the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance.  Expansion of M2 and M3 moderated further in August. For the year through August, M2 has grown at a rate slightly above, and M3 at a rate more noticeably above, the midpoints of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 was unchanged in August after registering relatively strong growth in June and July. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below that in 1987.

Total nonfarm payroll employment grew considerably in the third quarter but the gains were less than those registered in the first half of the year and employment in manufacturing declined in August and September. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in September, remaining in the narrow range that has prevailed since early spring. Industrial production advanced only slightly on balance in August and September after a sharp increase in July, while housing construction has been flat in recent months. Consumer spending increased substantially on average in the third quarter but apparently slowed in recent months. Indicators of business capital spending suggest considerably slower expansion in the third quarter, following very rapid growth in the first half of the year. Preliminary data for the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in August showed a greater deficit than in July, but the average for July-August was slightly less than the second-quarter rate. The latest information on prices and wages suggests little if any change from recent trends.  Interest rates in long-term debt markets have declined a little further since the Committee meeting on September 20, while rates in short-term markets have edged higher. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined appreciably over the intermeeting period from the high level of last summer.  Expansion of M2 has slowed considerably in recent months; growth of M3 moderated in August and September but appears to have strengthened somewhat in October. Thus far this year, M2 has grown at a rate somewhat below, and M3 at a rate somewhat above, the midpoint of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988.

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in October and November, with sizable increases indicated in manufacturing after declines in late summer. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.4 percent in November, remained in the lower part of the range that has prevailed since early spring. Industrial production advanced considerably in October and November. Housing starts turned up in October after changing little on balance over the previous several months. Growth in consumer spending has been somewhat more moderate in recent months, and indicators of business capital spending suggest a substantially slower rate of expansion than earlier in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed further in the third quarter. Preliminary data for October indicate a small decline from the revised deficit for September. The latest information on prices and wages suggest little if any change from recent trends.  Interest rates have risen since the Committee meeting on November 1, with appreciable increases occurring in short-term markets. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined significantly further on balance over the intermeeting period.  Expansion of M2 and M3 strengthened in November from relatively slow rates of growth in previous months, especially in the case of M2. Thus far this year, M2 has grown at a rate a little below, and M3 at a rate a little above, the midpoint of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 has increased only slightly on balance over the past several months, bringing growth so far this year to 4 percent. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below that in 1987 and around the midpoint of the Committee's monitoring range for 1988.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in late June reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was also maintained at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  For 1989, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of  1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989, of 3 to 7 percent forM2and3-1/2to7-1/2percent for M3. TheCommittee set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. It was understood that all these ranges were provisional and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the light of intervening developments.  With respect to M1,the Committee reaffirmed its decision in February not to establish a specific target for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the inter meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about 3 and 6-1/2 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent.",198812,0,261,1988-12-31,0.22,0.22,0.07,0.32,0.85,0.65,0.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1988-12-14

Hoskins and Parry dissenting from the operational paragraph on policy implementation in the period immediately ahead, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, apart from the direct effects of the drought, economic activity has continued to expand at a fairly vigorous pace. After strong gains in the fourth quarter, total nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions that will foster price in January, including a sizable increase in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.4 percent in January, remained in the lower part of the range that has prevailed since the early spring of last year. Industrial production rose appreciably further in December and January. Housing starts declined somewhat in December but were up substantially on balance in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending advanced considerably in the fourth quarter, in part reflecting stronger sales of durable goods. Indicators of business capital spending suggest some weakening in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was slightly larger on average in October and November than in the third quarter. The latest information on prices suggests little change from recent trends, while wages have tended to accelerate.  The federal funds rate and Treasury bill rates have risen since the Committee meeting in mid-December; other short-term interest rates are generally unchanged to somewhat lower. Bond yields have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose substantially over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 weakened appreciably in January, especially M2. For the year 1988, M2 expanded at a rate a little below, and M3 at a rate around, the midpoint of the ranges established by the Committee. M1 has changed little on balance over the past several months; it grew about 4-1/4 percent in 1988. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat in 1988 to a pace around the midpoint of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting reaffirmed its decision of late June to lower the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 to 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 2 and 3-1/2 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent.",198902,0,263,1989-02-28,-0.41,0.16,-0.06,-0.17,-0.49,0.28,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1989-02-08

After strong gains in the fourth quarter, total nonfarm payroll employment rose markedly further in January and February. The civilian unemployment rate fell considerably to 5.1 percent in February. Industrial production was unchanged in February after rising substantially over the previous several months. After a weather-related surge in January, housing starts fell in February to a level somewhat below their average in the fourth quarter. Growth in consumer spending moderated in January and February. Recent indicators of business capital spending suggest a rebound after a decline in the fourth quarter. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was larger in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter; the preliminary estimate of the deficit for January was smaller than the average for the fourth quarter. The latest information on prices suggests some pickup in inflation from recent trends.  Interest rates in both short- and long-term markets have risen considerably since the Committee meeting in early February. On February 24 the Federal Reserve Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 6-1/2 to 7 percent. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in February and apparently picked up further in March; over the first quarter such expansion was about in line with Committee expectations. M1 appears to have declined marginally since December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively,  measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 3 and 5 percent, respectively.

Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment moderated substantially in March and April, and employment in manufacturing was about unchanged over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose considerably to 5.3 percent in April. Industrial production increased in April after declining on balance in the preceding two months. Growth in consumer spending has slowed considerably in recent months. Housing starts declined further in April. Recent indicators of business capital spending show a rebound after a decline in the fourth quarter. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was smaller on average in January and February than in the fourth quarter. Broad measures of prices have risen somewhat more rapidly in 1989, with a significant contribution from sharp increases in energy prices.  Interest rates have declined considerably since the Committee meeting in late March. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose further on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 was sluggish in April, primarily because of a sizable decline in transactions balances. Through April, expansion of M2 has been at a rate below the Committee's range for the year, while growth of M3 has been in the lower portion of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year.

Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment have moderated substantially in recent months, but the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.2 percent in May, remained close to its average level in earlier months of the year. Industrial production increased on balance in April and May at about the reduced rate experienced earlier in the year. Growth in consumer spending has weakened considerably this year. Housing starts declined slightly further in May. Recent indicators of business capital spending suggest a substantial additional increase in the second quarter after a rebound in the first quarter. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April from a substantially reduced average value in the first quarter. Broad measures of prices have risen more rapidly this year than in 1988, reflecting sharp increases in energy and food prices.  Interest rates have fallen since the Committee meeting on May 16, with the largest declines generally occurring in long-term markets. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose sharply earlier in the intermeeting period but subsequently more than retraced that rise in often volatile trading.  M2 and M3 declined in May, primarily because of sizable reductions in transaction and other liquid balances arising from the clearing of unusually large tax payments; data through mid-June point to a rebound in these measures of money. Thus far this year, expansion of M2 has been at a rate below the Committee's annual range, while growth of M3 has been around the lower bound of the Committee's range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic non financial debt also was maintained at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year. For 1990, on a tentative basis, the Committee agreed to use the same ranges as in 1989 for growth in each of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the inter meeting period.

In July, total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further after a large advance in June, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.2 percent, remained close to its average level in earlier months of the year. Industrial production edged higher in July, continuing the slower growth observed since the beginning of the year. Retail sales have grown at a moderate pace in recent months. Housing starts rose slightly further in July following a large gain in June. Recent indicators of business capital spending suggest slower growth after the substantial increase in the first half of the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed considerably in June and for the second quarter as a whole was about unchanged from a substantially reduced average value in the first quarter. Partly reflecting reductions in energy prices, increases in consumer prices moderated in June and July. The latest wage data suggest no change in prevailing trends.  Interest rates show mixed changes on balance since the Committee meeting on July 5-6. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 grew markedly in July, lifting expansion of M2 thus far this year to around the lower end of the Committee's annual range, and keeping M3 somewhat above the lower bound of the Committee's range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic non financial debt also was maintained at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year. For 1990, on a tentative basis, the Committee agreed in July to use the same ranges as in 1989 for growth in each of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the inter meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of about 9 and 7 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent.",198908,0,269,1989-08-31,0.33,-0.14,0.09,0.32,0.61,-0.26,-0.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1989-08-22

In July and August, total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably despite the depressing effect of strike activity. The civilian unemployment rate remained around 5-1/4 percent. Industrial production picked up in August, mainly because of a rebound in auto assemblies and coal mining. Consumer spending has registered larger gains in recent months, reflecting in part a surge in auto sales. Housing starts in July and August were slightly above their second-quarter average. Indicators of business capital spending suggest somewhat slower growth in the third quarter after the substantial increase in the first half of the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit recorded a further decline in July relative to June and to the average for the second quarter as a whole. Sharp reductions in energy prices over the summer months damped increases in consumer prices and contributed to declines in producer prices. The latest wage data suggest no change in prevailing trends.  Interest rates generally show small mixed changes on balance since the Committee meeting on August 22.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell after the release of the G-7 statement on September 23; on balance, the dollar depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period.  M2 grew fairly briskly in August and evidently also in September, lifting its expansion thus far this year to somewhat above the lower end of the Committee's annual range. M3 grew at a substantially reduced pace in this period, as assets of thrift institutions and their associated funding needs apparently contracted further; for the year to date, M3 has grown at a rate around the lower bound of the Committee's annual range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably in October, but on balance its growth has been more moderate over the past several months, especially in the private sector. The civilian unemployment rate has remained around 5-1/4 percent. Strike activity and other disruptions depressed industrial production noticeably in October. Retail sales fell appreciably in October, reflecting a sharp drop in purchases of motor vehicles, but some upward revisions were made for August and September. Housing starts fell further in September and for the third quarter as a whole were about unchanged from their reduced second-quarter average. Indicators of business capital spending suggest slower growth after a substantial increase in the first half of the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in August from its July rate as non-oil imports increased markedly. Consumer prices have risen more slowly on balance since midyear, partly reflecting sharp reductions in energy prices, but the latest data on labor compensation suggest no significant change in prevailing trends.  Most interest rates have declined appreciably since the Committee meeting on October 3. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 continued to grow fairly briskly in October, largely reflecting strength in its M1 and other liquid components; thus far this year M2 has expanded at a pace somewhat below the midpoint of the Committee's annual range. Growth of M3 picked up in October but has remained much more restrained than that of M2, as assets of thrift institutions and their associated funding needs apparently continued to contract; for the year to date, M3 has grown at a rate around the lower bound of the Committee's annual range.

Angell and Melzer dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding slowly in the current quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment has increased at a reduced pace on average over the past several months, with declines continuing in the manufacturing sector. The civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent in November. Industrial production rose slightly in November after a decline in October resulting from strike activity and other disruptions. Nominal retail sales excluding motor vehicles strengthened in November, but continued weak sales of vehicles held total retail sales for the month to a level that was little changed from the third-quarter average. Housing starts fell in November but for the October-November period were up somewhat on average from their third-quarter level. Indicators of business capital spending suggest a weakening in expenditures after a substantial increase earlier in the year. The preliminary data indicate that the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened appreciably in October from an upward revised September rate. Broad measures of inflation suggest that prices have risen more slowly on balance since midyear, partly reflecting sharp reductions in energy prices, but the latest data on labor compensation suggest no significant change in prevailing trends.  Interest rates have changed little on balance since the Committee meeting on November 14. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined substantially over the intermeeting period, with a particularly pronounced depreciation against the German mark and related European currencies in the last week of the period.  M2 continued to grow fairly briskly in November, largely reflecting strength in its retail deposit components; M2 has expanded this year at a pace near the midpoint of the Committee's annual range. Growth of M3 picked up in November but has remained more restrained than that of M2, as assets of thrift institutions and their associated funding needs  apparently continued to contract; for the year to date, M3 has grown at a rate a little above the lower bound of the Committee's annual range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic non financial debt also was maintained at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year. For 1990, on a tentative basis, the Committee agreed in July to use the same ranges as in 1989 for growth in each of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

Boykin and Hoskins dissenting from the operational paragraph on policy implementation in the period  immediately ahead, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following  domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand despite weakness in the industrial sector. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially in January after growing at a reduced pace on average in previous months; a surge in the service-producing sector and a weather-related rebound in construction were only partly offset by a large decline in the manufacturing sector. The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent. Partial data suggest that industrial production in January was appreciably below its average in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for inflation, strong gains in consumer spending on services in the fourth quarter offset declines in consumer purchases of goods, especially motor vehicles. Unusually cold weather depressed housing starts appreciably in December, and residential construction in the fourth quarter was little changed from its third-quarter level. Business capital spending, adjusted for inflation, declined in the fourth quarter as a result of lower expenditures on motor vehicles and strike activity in the aircraft industry; spending on other types of capital goods was strong, however, and new orders for equipment picked up toward the end of the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in October-November from the third-quarter rate. Consumer prices had risen somewhat more rapidly toward the end of 1989, and prices of food and energy apparently increased substantially further in January. The latest data on labor compensation suggest no significant change in prevailing trends.  Interest rates have risen in intermediate- and long-term debt markets since the Committee meeting on December 18-19; in short-term markets, the federal funds rate has declined, and other short-term rates show mixed changes over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the intermeeting period; most of the depreciation was against the German mark and related European currencies, and there was little change against the yen.  Growth of M2 slowed in January, almost entirely reflecting a drop in transaction deposits. Growth of M3 also slowed in January as assets of thrift institutions and their associated funding needs apparently continued to contract. For the year 1989, M2 expanded at a rate a little below the middle of the Committee's annual range, and M3 grew at a rate slightly below the lower bound of its annual range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic non financial debt was set at 5 to 9 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 7 and 3-1/2 percent respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",199002,0,275,1990-02-28,0.51,0.12,-0.08,0.28,0.83,0.14,0.04,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1990-02-07

Boykin and Hoskins dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some pickup in the expansion of economic activity from the sluggish rate in the fourth quarter. Total non farm payroll employment increased sharply in January  and February after growing at a reduced pace on average in previous months; a surge in the service producing sector and a weather-related rebound in construction were only partly offset by a net decline in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent. In February, production in the manufacturing sector retraced its large January decline, reflecting a swing in the production of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been affected in recent months by fluctuations in expenditures for motor vehicles and energy-related items but on balance has expanded at a relatively slow pace; outlays for goods have been weak while expenditures for services have remained strong. Unusually mild weather contributed to a higher level of housing starts in January and February. Business capital spending, adjusted for inflation, appears to have turned up after a decline in the fourth quarter, reflecting a pickup in expenditures on motor vehicles and aircraft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in January from its low December rate but remained at roughly its fourth-quarter average. Consumer prices rose more rapidly over January and February, only partly as a result of increases in prices of food and energy.  Most short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen a little since the Committee meeting on February 6-7; rates in long-term debt markets show mixed changes over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose over the intermeeting period; much of the appreciation of the dollar was against the yen.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up considerably in February, reflecting strength in transaction and other liquid accounts; partial data for March suggested some slowing from the February pace.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 5 to 9 percent for the year.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 6 and 4 percent respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased more slowly in March and April after sharp advances earlier in the year; its average growth thus far this year has been above that in the second half of 1989, in part because of the hiring of temporary workers for the census. In April, the civilian unemployment rate moved up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production declined in April, reflecting what appears to be a temporary cutback in the manufacture of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been sluggish on balance in recent months; outlays for goods have been  weak while expenditures for services have remained strong. Business spending for equipment has been rising, but construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, appears to have weakened after a temporary boost early in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed somewhat in January and February from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices continued to rise at a faster pace in March than in 1989; producer prices were down somewhat further in April, reflecting additional unwinding of the earlier surge in prices of food and energy. The latest data on employment costs suggest some deterioration in underlying trends.  Short-term interest rates have declined a little on balance since the Committee meeting on March 27, while rates in long-term debt markets have risen slightly over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined considerably over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 slowed in April and that of M3 remained relatively weak. Through April, expansion of M2 and M3 was a little above the midpoint and around the lower end, respectively, of the ranges established by the Committee for 1990.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter national transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 5 to 9 percent for the year.

Total nonfarm payroll employment has increased at a much reduced rate in recent months. Nevertheless, the civilian unemployment rate has remained in a narrow range for an extended period and was 5.3 percent in May. Industrial production increased substantially in May, largely reflecting a rebound in the manufacture of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been sluggish in recent months; outlays for goods have declined while expenditures for services have increased at a slower pace. Business capital spending appears to have slackened a bit in the spring after a pickup earlier in the year. Residential construction has fallen to a relatively low level in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April from its average rate in the first quarter. Partly reflecting an unwinding of the earlier jump in prices of food and energy, consumer prices rose at a slower rate in April and May, while producer prices were unchanged over the two months. The latest data on wages suggest no improvement in underlying trends.  Short-term interest rates have changed little on balance since the Committee meeting on May 15, while rates in long-term debt markets have declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies.was somewhat higher over much of the period but declined late in the period to a level slightly below that prevailing at the time of the May meeting.  M2 and M3 declined in May; available data for June suggest a partial rebound in M2 and little change in M3. Growth of M2 and especially of M3 has been damped by the continuing contraction of deposits of thrift institutions resulting from the restructuring of the thrift industry. Through June, expansion of M2 was estimated to be in the lower portion of its range for 1990 and growth of M3 somewhat below its range for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been at the midpoint of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established in February for M2 growth of 3 to 7 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 5 to 9 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. With regard to M3, the Committee recognized that the ongoing restructuring of thrift depository institutions had depressed its growth relative to spending and total credit more than anticipated. Taking account of the unexpectedly strong M3 velocity, the Committee decided to reduce the 1990 range to 1 to 5 percent. For 1991, the Committee agreed on provisional ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991, of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3. The Committee tentatively set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1991. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.

After a sizable rise in May and June, total nonfarm payroll employment registered a large decline in July, much but not all of which reflected layoffs of temporary census workers. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent in July, just above the narrow range that had prevailed for an extended period. Industrial production was unchanged in July after rising appreciably in the second quarter. Retail sales rose considerably on balance over June and July after declines in earlier months. Available indicators point to a sluggish trend in business capital spending. Residential  construction weakened further in July. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed sharply in June; for the second quarter, the trade deficit was substantially reduced from its first-quarter rate. Consumer prices rose appreciably further in June and July, while producer prices were about unchanged over the two months. The latest data on labor costs suggest no improvement in underlying trends. Crude oil prices have risen sharply over the last several weeks.  Short-term interest rates have fallen somewhat since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, while rates in bond markets have risen appreciably, as oil prices have increased. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined considerably over the intermeeting period.  M2 grew slowly in June and July, while M3 was little changed; available data for August suggest a partial rebound in both aggregates. Growth of M2 and especially of M3 has been damped by the continuing contraction of deposits at thrift institutions resulting from the restructuring of the thrift industry. Through July, expansion of both M2 and M3 was estimated to be in the lower portions of their respective ranges for 1990. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established in February for M2 growth of 3 to 7 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The Committee in July also retained the monitoring range of 5 to 9 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. With regard to M3, the Committee recognized that the on going restructuring of thrift depository institutions had depressed its growth relative to spending and total credit more than anticipated. Taking account of the unexpectedly strong M3 velocity, the Committee decided in July to reduce the 1990 range to 1 to 5 percent. For 1991, the Committee agreed on pro visional ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991, of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3. The Committee tentatively set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic non  financial debt at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1991. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of about 4 and 2-1/2 percent respectively.

Angell, Boykin, Hoskins, and Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity expanded at a slow pace in the third quarter. The recent large increase in oil prices has boosted key measures of inflation and eroded real personal income; however, data available thus far provide only limited evidence of a retarding effect on production and aggregate spending. Total nonfarm payroll employment declined in July and August, reflecting layoffs of temporary census workers; employment in the private sector changed little over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent in August. Consumer spending appeared to be about unchanged in real terms  over July and August but was at a level significantly above the average for the second quarter. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to some softening in investment in coming months. Residential construction weakened further in August. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased sharply in July from the low rate in June. Markedly higher oil prices contributed to substantial increases in consumer and producer prices in August; excluding energy and food items, consumer inflation has picked up from the second-quarter rate. Data on labor costs suggest no improvement in underlying trends.  In short-term debt markets, Treasury bill rates have fallen somewhat since the Committee meeting on August 21, while rates on private market instruments are little changed. In the bond markets, most rates have edged lower on balance over this period. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined slightly further on balance from the low level reached at the time of the August meeting.  M2 and M3 expanded at appreciably faster rates in August; available data for September suggest continued strength in M2 and some slowing in the growth of M3. More rapid expansion of Ml and money market funds has contributed to the greater strength in the broad aggregates over the two months. Through September, expansion of M2 was estimated to be a little below the middle of the Committee's range for the year and growth of M3 in the lower portion of its range. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established in February for M2 growth of 3 to 7 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990.

Total nonfarm payroll employment declined further in October, reflecting sizable job losses in manufacturing and construction; the civilian unemployment rate held steady at 5.7 percent. Industrial production declined sharply in October after rising moderately during the summer. Consumer spending is estimated to have flattened out in real terms over August and September when a surge in energy prices caused a substantial drop in real disposable income. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to considerable softening in investment in coming months. Residential construction weakened further in the third quarter.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened substantially in July-August from its average rate in the second quarter as imports strengthened. Markedly higher oil prices have boosted consumer and producer prices in recent months. The latest data on labor costs suggest some slight improvement from earlier trends.  Most interest rates have fallen somewhat since the Committee meeting on October 2. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined considerably further over the intermeeting period.  In October, M2 grew only slightly after two months of relatively rapid expansion, while M3 was about unchanged.

Total nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply further in November, reflecting widespread job losses that were especially pronounced in manufacturing and construction; the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.9 percent. Industrial output declined markedly in October and November, in part because of sizable cutbacks in the production of motor vehicles. Retail sales were weak in real terms in October and November; real disposable income has been reduced not only by a decrease in total hours worked but also by the effects of higher energy prices. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to considerable softening in investment in coming months. Residential construction has declined substantially further in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in October from its average rate in the third quarter as non-oil imports rose more sharply than exports. Increases in consumer prices moderated in November largely as a result of a softening in oil prices. The latest data on labor costs suggest some improvement from earlier trends.  Most interest rates have fallen appreciably since the Committee meeting on November 13. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 was about unchanged on balance over October and November after several months of relatively limited expansion, while M3 declined slightly in both months. From the fourth quarter of 1989 through November, expansion of M2 was estimated to be in the lower half of the Committee's range for the year and growth of M3 near the lower end of its range. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range.

Taking account of the unexpectedly strong M3 velocity, the Committee decided in July to reduce the 1990 range to 1 to 5 percent. For 1991, the Committee agreed on pro visional ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991, of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3. The Committee tentatively set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic non financial debt at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1991. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible change in the discount rate. Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the inter meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about 4 and 1 percent, respectively.",199012,1,285,1990-12-31,-0.56,-0.35,-0.22,-0.29,-1.42,-1.67,-0.81,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1990-12-18

Total nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply further in December and January, reflecting widespread job losses that were especially pronounced in manufacturing and construction; the civilian unemployment rate rose to 6.2 percent in January. Industrial output declined markedly in the fourth quarter, in part because of sizable cutbacks in the production of motor vehicles, and partial data suggest a further drop in January. Consumer spending has remained soft. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to considerable weakness in investment in coming months. Residential construction has declined substantially further in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in November, as the value of imports declined more than that of exports; the average deficit for October and November exceeded that for the third quarter. Increases in consumer prices moderated and producer prices changed little in November and December, largely as a result of a softening in energy prices. The latest data suggest some further deceleration in wages and overall labor costs.  Short-term interest rates have fallen consider ably since the Committee meeting on December 18, while rates in longer-term markets are unchanged to down slightly. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 7 to 6-1/2 percent on December 18 and a further reduction to 6 percent on February 1. In foreign exchange markets, the trade weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 remained sluggish in December and January; expansion of M3 picked up in January from the very slow pace of recent months. For the year 1990, M2 and M3 expanded at rates in the lower portions of the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote a resumption of sustainable growth in output, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the ongoing restructuring of thrift depository institutions would continue to depress its growth relative to spending and total credit. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of both M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 3-1/2 to 4 percent.",199102,1,287,1991-02-28,-0.56,-0.84,-0.05,-0.11,-1.56,-1.54,-0.75,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1991-02-06

InFebruary,total nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply further, especially in manufacturing, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 6.5 percent. Industrial output also declined markedly again in February, with cutbacks evident in a wide range of industries. Advance indicators point to further weakness in business fixed investment in coming months, notably in nonresidential construction. On the other hand, after declining considerably in previous months, retail sales turned up in February; consumer sentiment appears to have rebounded sharply in recent weeks. Housing starts jumped in February, retracing a sizable decline in January but remaining at a low level. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased somewhat in January but was considerably below its average rate in the fourth quarter. Energy prices fell substantially further in January and February, but prices of other consumer goods and services rose more rapidly than in preceding months. Wage increases have moderated in recent months.  Short-term interest rates have declined slightly since the Committee meeting on February 5-6. In longer-term markets, rates on Treasury bonds have risen appreciably, owing at least in part to heightened expectations of a recovery in U.S. economic activity. Risk premiums on corporate debt instruments have declined, and stock prices have moved up considerably on balance. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased very sharply over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened substantially in February, reflecting rapid expansion in liquid retail deposits; partial data suggest appreciable further growth in March.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote a resumption of sustainable growth in output, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991.

Following sharp decreases in previous months, total nonfarm payroll employment fell somewhat further in April; the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 6.6 percent. Industrial output changed little in April after declining markedly in earlier months. Retail sales were about unchanged in April and are now indicated to have risen somewhat in March. Advance indicators continue to point to weakness in business fixed investment in coming months. Housing starts were down in March, partly offsetting a sizable advance in February, but sales of new and existing homes continued to rise. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined in February and its January-February rate was considerably below the average rate in the fourth quarter. Producer and consumer prices were little changed over March and April, partly reflecting further reductions in energy prices.  Short-term interest rates have declined since the Committee meeting on March 26, while bond yields have changed little. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 6 to 5-1/2 percent on April 30. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies showed little change on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 weakened in April; for the year thus far, expansion of M2 has been at the midpoint of the Committee's range, while growth of M3 has been in the upper half of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote a resumption of sustainable growth in output, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions.

Angell and Black from the decision relating to the monetary growth ranges for 1992, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has begun to recover from the recent recession. The unemployment rate rose to 6.9 percent in May, but total nonfarm payroll employment edged up and the average workweek posted a sizable gain. Manufacturing output has risen in recent months, led by appreciable increases in assemblies of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been bolstered in part by an upturn in personal income. An increase in orders points to a firming in demand for business equipment, but nonresidential construction remains weak. Housing  starts rose over April and May. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in April was somewhat below the average rate in the first quarter. Increases in consumer prices have been small in recent months.  Most interest rates have risen slightly since the Committee meeting on May 14. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased substantially on balance over the inter meeting period.  M2 grew at a moderate pace over May and June, while M3 changed little. For the year thus far, expansion of M2 and M3 has been in the middle portion of the Committee's ranges.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee re affirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. For 1992, on a tentative basis, the Committee agreed to use the same ranges as in 1991 for growth in each of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the ongoing restructuring of thrift depository institutions would continue to depress the growth of this aggregate relative to spending and total credit. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.

The unemployment rate fell slightly to 6.8 percent in July, but total nonfarm payroll employment edged down and the average workweek posted a sharp decline. Industrial production rose appreciably further in July. Consumer spending has increased considerably in recent months, led by sizable gains in expenditures for motor vehicles. New orders for nondefense capital goods point to little change in spending for business equipment over the near term, and nonresidential construction remains weak. Housing starts rose further in June and July. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined in June, and its average for the second quarter was somewhat below the rate in the first quarter. Increases in consumer prices have been small in recent months.  Over the intermeeting period prior to August 19, market interest rates declined appreciably and the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat. Sub sequently, in the wake of events in the Soviet Union, Treasury bill rates fell somewhat further and the dollar rebounded sharply against many European currencies.  M2 contracted in July after several months of slow growth and M3 fell further. For the year through July, expansion of M2 and M3 has been near the lower ends of the Committee's ranges.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. For 1992, on a tentative basis, the Committee agreed in July to use the same ranges as in 1991 for growth in each of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the ongoing restructuring of thrift depository institutions would continue to depress the growth of this aggregate relative to spending and total credit. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with a resumption of growth of M2 and M3 in  the weeks ahead; but in view of the declines already posted since June, the Committee anticipates that M2 would be little changed and M3 would be down at an annual rate of about 1 percent over the period from June through September.",199108,0,293,1991-08-31,0.01,-0.19,-0.15,-0.16,-0.49,-0.17,-0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1991-08-20

Total nonfarm payroll employment changed little over July and August, and the civilian unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in both months. Employment in manufacturing continued to advance in August, and industrial production posted a further rise after several months of sizable gains. Consumer spending increased considerably on balance in July and August. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital  goods point to a small increase in real outlays for business equipment, but nonresidential construction has remained weak. Housing starts rose only slightly further in July and August after increasing appreciably on balance since January. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened substantially in July and was considerably above its average rate in the second quarter. Increases in consumer prices have been small in recent months, owing to declines in food and energy prices.  Most interest rates have declined further since the Committee meeting on August 20. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 5-1/2 to 5 percent on September 13.   The trade weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell sharply over the intermeeting period; much of the drop retraced the previous run-up associated with the attempted coup in the Soviet Union that began shortly before the August Committee meeting.  After contracting in July, M2 was about unchanged in August and September. M3 declined further in July and August and is indicated to have changed little in September. For the year thus far, expansion of M2 and M3 has been at the lower end of the Committee's ranges.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

Angell and Kelley dissenting, the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting portrays a sluggish economy and a marked deterioration in business and consumer confidence. Total nonfarm pay roll employment was unchanged in October after rising slightly over the third quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate edged back up to 6.8 percent. Industrial production has been flat in recent months. Consumer spending increased considerably through the summer, in part because of a sizable rise in expenditures on motor vehicles; sales of motor vehicles slowed in October, however. Real outlays for business equipment--especially for computers--have been rising, but nonresidential construction has continued to decline. Housing starts and home sales have weakened recently. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July-August was significantly above its average rate in the second quarter. Wage and price increases have continued to trend downward.  Short-term interest rates have declined somewhat further since the Committee meeting on October 1, while bond yields are about unchanged to slightly higher on balance. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting period.  Expansion in M2 and M3 resumed in October, albeit at a slow pace. For the year through October, expansion of both M2 and M3 is estimated to have been at the lower ends of the Committee's ranges.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

Total nonfarm pay roll employment fell sharply in November; however, the average workweek in the private nonfarm sector edged up and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 6.8 percent. Industrial production fell in November, partly reflecting a sizable drop in motor vehicle assemblies. Consumer spending has been soft on balance in recent months. Real outlays for business equipment appear to be rising slowly, and nonresidential construction has continued to decline. Housing starts were appreciably higher on average in October and November than in the third quarter. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly further in September; the deficit in the third quarter was substantially larger than in the second quarter. Wage and price increases have continued to trend downward.  Interest rates have declined appreciably since the Committee meeting on November 5. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 5 to 4-1/2 percent on November 6. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the intermeeting period; the dollar depreciated primarily against the mark and other European currencies.  Expansion in M2 and M3 edged up in November from a slow pace in October; the slightly faster growth reflected a strengthening in the most liquid components of the aggregates. For the year through November, expansion of both M2 and M3 is estimated to have been at the lower ends of the Committee's ranges.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991.

Total nonfarm payroll employment was little changed in December, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent. Industrial production fell slightly in November and December, partly reflecting a sizable drop in motor vehicle assemblies. Consumer spending has been weak on balance in recent months amid continuing indications of depressed consumer confidence and essentially no growth in disposable income. Demand for business equipment has been uneven, while nonresidential construction has remained in a steep decline. Single-family housing starts continued to recover in December. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in November, and for October-November combined the trade balance improved substantially from the third-quarter rate. Wage and price increases have continued to trend downward.  Short-term interest rates have declined appreciably since the Committee meeting on December 17, while longer-term rates have registered mixed changes. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 4-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent on December 20. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.  After accelerating somewhat in the fourth quarter, M2 and M3 slowed in January, partly reflecting temporary distortions around year-end. For the year 1991, the expansion of both M2 and M3 is estimated to have been at rates a little above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been marginally above the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this  meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the ongoing restructuring of depository institutions would continue to depress the growth of this aggregate relative to spending and total credit. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

Retail sales registered large gains in January and February, with data on inventories, which are available through January, showing some offsetting decline in that month. Single-family housing starts increased substantially further in January and February. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate an increase in outlays for business equipment, but nonresidential construction has remained in a steep decline. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in January and was essentially unchanged from its average rate in the fourth quarter.  Industrial production rose considerably in February, partly reflecting an upturn in motor vehicle assemblies, but was little changed on balance over the first two months of the year. Total nonfarm payroll employment rebounded in February from a large decline in January. With the labor force growing appreciably in recent months, the civilian unemployment rate has risen to 7.3 percent. Wage and price increases have continued to trend downward.  Most interest rates have risen appreciably since the Committee meeting on February 4-5. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased substantially over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 accelerated in February, but M2 appears to have leveled off and M3 to have declined in March. Much of the growth in the broader aggregates over recent months has been accounted for by a surge in transactions balances.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the ongoing re structuring of depository institutions would continue to depress the growth of this aggregate relative to spending and total credit.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased somewhat in April, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.2 percent. Industrial production rose appreciably further in April partly reflecting some further recovery in motor vehicle  assemblies. A rebound in retail sales in April about offset the decline in March. Single-family housing starts fell considerably for a second month in April. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate appreciable increases in outlays for business equipment, and building contracts point to some slowing of the decline in nonresidential construction. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January-February was somewhat below its average rate in the fourth quarter. Incoming data on prices and labor costs suggest little change from recent trends.  Most interest rates have fallen since the Committee meeting on March 31.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 contracted in March and April; and expansion in transactions balances, which had accounted for much of the growth in the broader aggregates over previous months, slowed markedly.

LaWare and Melzer dissenting from the operational paragraph on policy implementation in the period immediately ahead, and Ms. Phillips and Mr. Jordan dissenting from the decision relating to the monetary growth ranges for 1993, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting continues to suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased somewhat further in May, but a surge in job seekers led to a sizable rise in the civilian unemployment rate to 7.5 percent. Industrial production rose appreciably further in May, partly reflecting continued recovery in motor vehicle assemblies. Growth in consumer spending has slackened after a sharp advance earlier this year. Although sales of new  homes declined in May, single-family housing starts rebounded to a level close to the first-quarter pace. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate appreciable increases in outlays for business equipment, and the trend of building contracts points to some  slowing of the decline in nonresidential construction. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased in April and was substantially above its average rate in the first quarter. Incoming data on retail prices and labor costs suggest that inflation is slowing.  Most interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting on May 19. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 changed little in May and appear to have contracted in June; both retail and large denomination time deposits continued to run off rapidly. Through June, expansion of the two aggregates was somewhat below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist in the second half of the year. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. For 1993, the Committee on a tentative basis set the same ranges as in 1992 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.

LaWare and Melzer dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand at a subdued pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment rebounded in July after declining in June, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 percent. Manufacturing output was unchanged in July, but overall industrial production was boosted by a higher level of mining and utility output. Retail sales increased moderately in July. Permits issued for the construction of new housing units rose slightly in July, but housing starts fell. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate further increases in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in April-May was substantially above its average rate in the first quarter. Incoming data on wages and prices suggest that inflation is slowing.  Interest rates have declined considerably since the Committee meeting on June 30-July 1. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 3 percent on July 2. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the first several weeks of the intermeeting period, but it has stabilized more recently. M2 and M3 contracted somewhat further in July. Through July, both aggregates were appreciably below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.   The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting on June 30-July 1 reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist in the second half of the year. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic non financial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. For 1993, the Committee on a tentative basis set the same ranges as in 1992 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

Total nonfarm payroll employment declined somewhat further in September, but the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.5 percent. Industrial production is estimated to have declined appreciably since July. Real personal consumption expenditures appear to have risen moderately in the third quarter. Data on housing have been mixed, but on balance they continue to suggest a gradual uptrend in housing expenditures. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate slower growth in outlays for business equipment, while expenditures for non residential construction have been weak. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened somewhat in July from its average rate in the second quarter. Incoming data on wages and prices suggest that inflation is slowing.  Short-term interest rates have declined somewhat, while longer-term rates are about unchanged since the Committee meeting on August 18. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fluctuated widely over the intermeeting period but ended the period higher on balance.  Expansion of M2 and M3 resumed in August, though at fairly slow rates, and limited growth appears to have continued in September.

Recent data on wages and prices suggest on balance a possible slowing in the trend toward lower inflation.  Changes in short-term interest rates have been mixed since the Committee meeting on November 17 while  bond yields have edged lower. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was essentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity rose appreciably further in the fourth quarter. Final demands were buoyed by strength in consumption, business spending for durable equipment, and residential construction. Manufacturing activity also increased considerably, and employment appeared to be on a modest upward trajectory, despite a continuing flow of announcements of layoffs by large corporations. Although recent data on wages and prices had been mixed, on balance they suggested that inflation was trending gradually lower.  Total nonfarm payroll employment registered a small increase in December for the fourth consecutive month. Service industries, notably business and health services, and retail trade accounted for nearly all of the rise in jobs. Manufacturing and construction payrolls changed little, and government employment fell as temporary election workers were dropped from payrolls. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point below its mid-year peak but slightly above its level at the beginning of the year.  Industrial production advanced further in December and was up considerably over the fourth quarter as a whole. Motor vehicle assemblies rose sharply during the quarter; strong gains also were registered in business equipment, partly reflecting a further jump in output of computers, and in nondurable consumer goods. By contrast, the production of durable consumer goods other than motor vehicles was lower on balance after changing little over the third quarter, and the output of defense and space equipment remained on a downward trend. Total utilization of industrial capacity increased significantly in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole.  Consumer spending was up substantially in the fourth quarter. Retail sales, after rising sharply in October and changing little in November, posted a further sizable increase in December. The largest sales gains in the fourth quarter were reported at automotive dealers and at building material and supply outlets, but most other types of retail stores also recorded higher sales. By contrast, consumer spending for services, as indicated by data on personal consumption expenditures, rose more slowly. Housing starts surged in December, with single family starts reaching their highest level in nearly three years and multifamily starts picking up slightly from the very low levels of October and November. Sales of new and existing homes remained on a strong upward trend in December.  Real outlays for business fixed investment apparently registered a notable gain in the fourth quarter, particularly for producers' durable equipment. Shipments of nondefense capital goods rose in November and December after changing little in October; for the quarter as a whole, shipments advanced substantially, with increases widespread by category. Business purchases of cars and trucks were up sharply in the fourth quarter, while nonresidential construction activity retraced a small part of a third-quarter decline.  Business inventories expanded moderately in November as a sizable drop in manufacturing inventories was more than offset by increases in wholesale and retail inventories. At the manufacturing level, the drawdown of stocks was associated with strong shipments of durable goods, and inventory-to-shipments ratios in most industries were at or near the bottom of their recent ranges. In the wholesale sector, sizable inventory increases were reported in November for a second straight month; most of the buildup was limited to machinery, motor vehicles, and miscellaneous nondurable goods. With stocks rising in line with sales since September, the stock-to-sales ratio in wholesaling remained at the low end of its range over the past year. Retail inventories increased moderately further in November; the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector was slightly below its average for previous months of the year.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in November. For October and November together, however, the deficit narrowed a little from its average rate in the third quarter, as the value of exports rose more than the value of imports. Most of the increase in exports was in capital goods, both machinery and aircraft, and in consumer goods. Passenger cars accounted for a considerable part of the rise in imports, while the inflow of consumer goods eased from the very strong pace of the third quarter. Recent indicators suggested that economic activity had remained weak in the major foreign industrial countries and that unemployment rates had increased further in most of those countries. The recovery in Canada appeared to be continuing, but the downturn in western Germany and Japan evidently had persisted into the fourth quarter.  A small November decline in producer prices of finished goods was reversed in December, with a rebound in prices of finished foods outweighing a further drop in energy prices. For finished items other than food and energy, producer prices rose in December, but the advance followed six months of no change on balance; for 1992 as a whole, this measure of prices increased by a considerably smaller amount than in 1991. At the consumer level, the index for prices of nonfood, non-energy items edged higher in December after somewhat larger increases in the two preceding months. The rise in this index in 1992 was the smallest for any year since the early 1970s, when wage and price controls were in effect. Hourly compensation of private industry workers advanced a little more rapidly in the fourth quarter than in the two previous quarters, but the rise in total compensation over the year as a whole was considerably smaller than in 1991. The slowing of labor cost increases last year occurred in both the wages and benefits components.  At its meeting on December 22, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with expansion of M2 at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent and with M3 remaining about unchanged on balance over the four-month period from November through March.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was well above expected levels in the first two full reserve maintenance periods in the intermeeting interval; borrowing was sizable over the long New Year's weekend and also later when unusually heavy Treasury tax receipts drained reserves from the banking system. The federal funds rate averaged close to expected levels over the intermeeting period. However, the rate was somewhat volatile in late December as a result of sizable swings in market factors affecting reserves and of shifting market anticipations regarding year-end pressures.  Most other short-term interest rates declined somewhat over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting the passing of year-end pressures. Intermediate- and long-term rates, including those on fixed-rate mortgages, also moved somewhat lower; the declines occurred in response to growing indications that any proposed near-term fiscal stimulus would be quite moderate and that the new Administration intended to recommend steps, possibly including new taxes, to lower the trajectory of the fiscal deficit appreciably over time. Broad indexes of stock prices exhibited mixed results over the intermeeting period: Indexes giving heavy weight to large companies changed little, while those primarily reflecting smaller companies rose significantly.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over the intermeeting period. Through early January, the dollar appreciated against both the yen and the mark, especially the latter, in response to actual and expected further declines in interest rates in Japan and Germany. Subsequently, the dollar's gains were partially erased as the prospects for near-term easing in Germany diminished somewhat and perceptions grew that fiscal initiatives in the United States would lower the deficit and reduce the chances that monetary policy might be tightened in the months ahead.  After expanding at a moderate pace over the course of earlier months, M2 contracted in December and January. Some of the weakness reflected a slowdown in Ml growth associated with lower mortgage refinancing activity. Within M2's nontransaction component, the expansion of savings and money market deposit accounts slowed abruptly, perhaps owing in part to the wider spread that had developed during the fall between market rates and those paid on these accounts, as well as to the use of monies in these accounts to fund a step-up in consumer purchases and nonwithheld tax payments. In addition, the continued attractiveness to investors of bond and stock mutual funds might have contributed to a quickening of the runoff of holdings of money market mutual funds and to the persisting weakness in other M2 accounts. Appreciable declines in M3 in December and January reflected both the contraction in M2 and reduced needs by banks for managed liabilities at a time of weak overall credit demand. From the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have expanded at the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for 1992.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand over the year ahead at a pace that would be sufficient to reduce gradually margins of unemployed labor and capital. Recent declines in long-term interest rates and more optimistic attitudes on the part of businesses and households were expected to support further solid gains in business fixed investment and in homebuying. Continuing progress in reducing debt service burdens and a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security were projected to foster an expansion of consumer spending a shade faster than the growth in incomes. Export demand would be damped for some period of time by the appreciation of the dollar since mid-1992, but an anticipated pickup in growth abroad later this year would begin to counteract the effects of the higher dollar. Against the background of considerable uncertainties associated with still unannounced fiscal policy initiatives, the staff retained for this forecast the assumption contained in several previous forecasts that fiscal policy would remain mildly restrictive, largely because of declining defense outlays. The persisting slack in resource utilization over the forecast horizon was expected to be associated with some additional progress in reducing inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members were encouraged by the mounting evidence of appreciable momentum in the economic expansion. On the whole, recent developments tended to reinforce their forecasts of continuing growth at a moderate pace over the year ahead, especially in light of the improvement in business and consumer confidence. The impact of some retarding influences on the expansion, notably various balance sheet adjustment activities, appeared to be waning. In addition, while some major sectors of the economy such as defense spending and commercial construction remained weak, the economy was benefitting from considerable growth in consumer spending, from rising business expenditures for producer equipment, and from increasing outlays for housing. In one view, the recent behavior of commodity prices also tended to indicate some strengthening in the economy's expansion. Despite various indications of a more firmly established expansion, however, the members felt that the outlook remained subject to a good deal of uncertainty, and some commented that substantial deviations--in either direction--from their current forecasts could not be ruled out. It was noted in this connection that the specifics of the President's fiscal policy proposals were still unknown, and their reception by the public and the Congress would have a major influence on confidence, interest rates, and the performance of the economy. Other sources of uncertainty related to the outlook for further restructuring activities that involved cutbacks in operations and employment by many firms, and the prospective lending policies of banking institutions. With regard to the outlook for inflation, most of the members believed that some further progress toward stable prices was likely over the year ahead, given an economic outcome about in line with their forecasts of continued, albeit reduced, margins of unutilized or underutilized productive resources. Some members also referred to the extended period of relatively sluggish growth in the broad measures of money as a favorable indicator in the outlook for inflation.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for 1993. The central tendencies of the forecasts pointed to slightly faster economic growth this year than currently seemed to have occurred in 1992. The anticipated rate of economic expansion would be at a pace that was rapid enough to reduce the rate of unemployment a little further. Nonetheless, with some slack in productive resources persisting, price and cost pressures would remain subdued and modest additional moderation in inflation was expected by most members. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent within a full range of 2-1/2 to 4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1993 were concentrated in the upper half of a 6-1/2 to 7 percent range. For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993 was centered on increases in a range of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent, and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for the year.  In the course of the Committee's discussion of various factors underlying the outlook for economic activity, the members observed that on the whole the effects of a number of structural impediments to the expansion seemed to be diminishing as the financial condition of households, business firms, and financial institutions continued to improve. Household and business debt-service burdens had eased substantially, but it remained difficult to predict to what extent and for how long the ongoing balance sheet adjustments would continue to divert an unusual proportion of cash flows from spending to balance sheet repair. Improved profitability and new capital-market issuance had strengthened the capital positions of banking institutions, and in general they were now in a much better position to augment their lending activities. However, there were few indications thus far of any easing in terms or standards on business loans, and the depressed and uncertain values of commercial mortgages and real estate held in bank portfolios might continue to exert an inhibiting effect on the willingness of banks to lend. Another negative factor was the persistence of downsizing and other restructuring activities by numerous firms, notably large businesses. Such restructuring activities had not fully run their course as many firms continued to pare excess production capacity and to modernize production facilities to meet strong competition in domestic and foreign markets. The resulting layoffs had damped overall job growth.  Despite tepid job growth, retail sales had strengthened markedly during the closing months of 1992, and several members commented that such sales had continued to display surprising vigor in some parts of the country during the early weeks of 1993. Apart from the improvement in consumer sentiment, other favorable factors cited with regard to the outlook for consumer spending included lower debt-service burdens and the capital gains or enhanced cash flows now being realized as sales of homes picked up and mortgage refinancings again strengthened. Some members nonetheless expressed a degree of concern about the sustainability of the gains in consumer spending unless there were faster growth in employment and income to support such spending. Announcements by prominent firms of cutbacks in their workforces had continued into the new year, and while job gains at other firms, especially smaller ones, were contributing to modest net growth in overall employment, the publicity surrounding the persisting job cutbacks and a tendency for many new jobs to be lower-paying added an element of caution to the outlook for consumer expenditures. On balance, with the measured saving rate already at a low level, though an argument could be made that the actual rate was somewhat higher than indicated by the currently published data, consumer spending seemed likely to expand about in line with the growth in consumer incomes over the coming year.  The growth in consumer incomes in turn was likely to depend importantly on the expansion in business investment spending, and members cited a number of factors that were expected to provide a favorable setting for sustained momentum in such spending over the year ahead. These included the strengthening of final demands, the recent declines in intermediate -and long-term interest rates, the greater leeway for financial intermediaries to increase their lending to businesses, and a continuing desire by business firms to improve their operating efficiencies. Commercial construction activity, however, was likely to remain quite sluggish. There were indications that commercial real estate values had stabilized in a number of areas, but at low levels, and given the persistence of marked imbalances in numerous real estate markets that were the result of several years of overbuilding, a significant rebound in commercial building activity for the nation as a whole might well be several years away. The outlook for housing construction was much more promising. Against the background of a general upswing in consumer confidence and the improved balance sheets of many households, the declines that had occurred in mortgage interest rates had fostered a marked strengthening in the demand for single-family housing as evidenced by reports from many parts of the country as well as the overall statistics on housing. On the basis of these developments, the members anticipated a continuing impetus to the economic expansion from housing construction and from related industries over the year ahead. In addition, the current indications of generally lean business inventories, associated in part with strong final demands over the past several months, suggested that the prospects for further gains in overall spending were likely to stimulate efforts by business firms to build up inventories over the quarters ahead.  The increasing signs of slow growth or recession in a number of foreign nations represented a greater downside risk to the demand for U.S. exports than had been apparent earlier. It was noted, for example, that firms engaged in business activities abroad were reporting substantial deterioration in markets for U.S. goods in many foreign countries. Growth in U.S. exports might remain positive over the year ahead, but against the background of a relatively expansive U.S. economy and the dollar's recent appreciation, the value of exports might well fall increasingly short of that of imports with adverse effects on the growth of U.S. economic activity.  Turning to the outlook for fiscal policy, members were encouraged by the prospect that the President would soon propose a program that would produce substantial reductions in the federal deficit over the years ahead. Such a deficit-reduction program, if deemed credible, could result in lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates than would otherwise prevail--even before the program was enacted--with very positive implications for interest-sensitive expenditures. For the nearer term, the President was expected to announce some modest fiscal stimulus relative to what was currently in train. However, the specifics of the President's proposals were not yet known and there was little current basis on which to judge prospective public and Congressional reactions. Members emphasized the critical need for long-term deficit reduction, and some expressed concern about the adverse effects on financial markets if fiscal stimulus measures were to be enacted for the short run without the assurance of further legislation to cut federal deficits over time.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, most of the members anticipated that the trend toward lower price and wage inflation would be sustained over the year ahead, and one member observed that the disinflationary momentum in the economy might well be underestimated. Favorable developments relating to the outlook for inflation included evidence of slowing increases in labor costs and continued aggressive efforts by many business firms to improve productivity and reduce costs in the face of intense competition from domestic and foreign producers. Indeed, anecdotal reports from around the country continued to suggest little or no upward pressure on prices in many regions. In addition, the behavior of interest rates in longer-term debt markets was consistent with spreading expectations of gradually diminishing inflation. Some members believed, however, that little or no further progress in reducing inflation was a more likely outcome in the year ahead, though none anticipated higher inflation. Some commodity price indexes had edged higher recently, apparently in response to growing demands related to strengthening activity in several sectors of the economy. Lumber prices in particular had risen considerably in conjunction with the uptrend in single-family housing construction and various constraints on lumber supplies. Some business contacts reported for the first time in a long while that they were experiencing or anticipated some upward pressure on their raw materials prices. Further, while most business contacts saw or anticipated little or no upward pressure on prices in their own industries, many continued to expect rising inflation more generally. The still relatively steep slope of the yield curve and its implications with regard to expectations of future increases in interest rates also suggested that investors remained concerned about the possibility of higher inflation over the longer run, even though such concerns might have abated somewhat recently and did not appear to extend to the next year or two. In general, however, the members viewed the inflation outlook with considerable optimism on the presumption of favorable fiscal and monetary policy developments.  Turning to policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in reserve markets, and all indicated that they could accept a directive that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the likely direction of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. While there was concern about the weakness in the monetary aggregates, the members generally agreed that recent economic developments tended to reinforce the view that monetary policy was on an appropriate course. The economy seemed to be on a stronger growth track than earlier in the expansion, and inflation remained quite subdued--only a bit above some estimates of price stability--and likely to moderate further in coming quarters in the view of most members. Some commented that a further easing move at this juncture might well have adverse effects on inflation sentiment and on interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets. A few referred to the recent firming in some commodity prices and the consensus among private forecasters that inflation could drift higher over the next few years. In the view of one member, these developments might argue for a tilt in the directive toward possible restraint, but they did not call for an immediate tightening in reserve conditions.  A staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested a resumption of some growth in the broad measures of money later in the first quarter but a decline in both M2 and M3 for the quarter as a whole. While part of the declines appeared to reflect difficulties with seasonal adjustments and the ebbing of special factors that previously had boosted growth, the uncertainties surrounding the behavior of these aggregates tended to reduce their role in current monetary policy. Nevertheless, there was concern about the persisting weakness in the broad aggregates, including the likelihood that they would fall well short of the Committee's new ranges over the first part of the year. Some members also noted that the growth of Ml, while still fairly robust in December and January, was markedly below its pace over most of 1992. On the other hand, bank loans had increased in recent months, and the weakness in the monetary aggregates did not appear to reflect underlying softness in the economy. In these circumstances, a number of members believed that any effort to stimulate monetary growth under immediately prevailing economic conditions and market expectations might well prove to be counterproductive. An easing at this time could accelerate outflows from interest-sensitive M2 assets if the easing were seen as signaling a weakening of the System's anti-inflationary resolve and were to result in higher rates on intermediate- and long-term debt securities.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all of the members indicated that they favored a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. They also noted their preference for, or acceptance of, a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy over the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with little change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period from January through March.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that economic activity rose appreciably further in the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment registered another small increase in December, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent. Industrial production posted solid gains over the closing months of the year. Retail sales were up substantially in the fourth quarter, and residential construction activity increased sharply. Indicators of business fixed investment suggest a notable gain in recent months, particularly for producers' durable equipment. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in October-November from its average rate in the third quarter. Recent data on wages and prices have been mixed but they continue to suggest on balance a trend toward lower inflation.  Interest rates have declined somewhat since the Committee meeting on December 22. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 appears to have contracted in December and January, after expanding at a moderate pace over the course of previous months; M3 is estimated to have declined appreciably in both months. From the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee's annual ranges for 1992. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded at the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are likely to persist during the year. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with little change in M2 and M3 over the period from January to March.",199302,0,311,1993-02-28,0.12,0.21,-0.07,0.03,0.29,0.39,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1993-02-03

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a more moderate pace in the early months of 1993 after increasing substantially in the fourth quarter. Although outlays for business equipment apparently remained on a strong upward trajectory, sales of new homes had slackened and consumer spending was rising less rapidly. Indicators of production activity also were mixed: Industrial output had continued to post solid gains, but homebuilding had been less robust since year-end. Payroll employment had strengthened, and the unemployment rate had moved down further. Increases in wages had remained subdued in recent months, but advances in consumer and producer prices had been larger than those recorded in the latter part of 1992.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in February, following generally small advances in previous months, and the length of the average workweek remained at the fourth-quarter level. The strong job gains in construction, services, and retail trade in February apparently reflected to some extent a partial reversal of the special factors that had depressed reported employment in these sectors in previous months. Since December, initial claims for unemployment insurance had fluctuated in a range that was consistent with further modest growth in employment. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower again in February, to 7.0 percent.  Industrial production continued to rise at a fairly brisk pace in January and February. Changes in mining and utilities were about offsetting on balance over the two months, but increases in manufacturing were fairly widespread. Although motor vehicle assemblies fell in February from a relatively high January level, the production of consumer durables and computers turned up sharply. In addition, increases in output were recorded in several other categories, including non-energy materials and construction supplies. Recent surveys indicated that new orders for durable goods increased further in February, and lean factory inventories coupled with reports of lengthening delivery times suggested further gains in industrial output in coming months. Total utilization of industrial capacity rose again in February.  Retail sales advanced in February after a fourth-quarter surge and a pause in January. Sales at automotive dealers weakened in February. However, there were sharp increases in sales of building materials and supplies, miscellaneous durable goods, and nondurable goods other than apparel. After registering sizable gains late last year, housing starts fell substantially in January and retraced only part of that decline in February. The slowdown was concentrated in single-family housing starts; multifamily starts were up in February from a historically low level in January. Although mortgage interest rates had dropped to the lowest levels in decades, sales of both new and existing homes turned down in January from their high December levels.  Incoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggested a further brisk advance in outlays for business equipment in coming months. In January, a decline in shipments of nondefense capital goods only partially reversed a large December rise, as a surge in shipments of computing equipment helped sustain the overall level. Shipments of complete civilian aircraft posted a solid gain in January. The increase appeared to be concentrated in sales to foreign purchasers; in the domestic airline industry, intense competition was forcing cutbacks of unprofitable routes and reductions in both the number of planes in service and orders for new planes. Shipments of durable equipment other than computers and aircraft fell in January to about the level of the fourth quarter. On the other hand, the January reading on new orders for these goods was well above the average for the fourth quarter, suggesting that additional advances in shipments might lie ahead. Nonresidential construction activity was down slightly further in January, reflecting persisting declines in office and industrial building in an environment of excess supply and some continuing, though perhaps lessening, downward pressure on the prices of such structures.  Business inventories appeared to have edged lower in January. In manufacturing, factory stocks were drawn down further, and most industries had relatively low stocks-to-shipments ratios. Among wholesalers, strong January sales pulled down inventories at many types of establishments; in numerous cases, a large accumulation of stocks in the fourth quarter was reversed. For the wholesale sector as a whole, the inventories-to-sales ratio in January was near the bottom of the range of the past two years. Retail inventories rose somewhat further in January after a large December increase. Stocks at automotive dealers accounted for all of the January accumulation. At retail stores other than auto dealers, the ratio of inventories-to-sales remained within the narrow range observed over the past year.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in January but was little changed from its average level in the fourth quarter. The value of both exports and imports dropped sharply in January from the December levels. The decline in imports was spread widely among major trade categories, but the decrease in exports largely reflected a reduction in shipments of aircraft after a strong December rise. Among the major foreign industrialized countries, the level of real activity contracted further in the fourth quarter in Japan, western Germany, and France; for the first quarter, the limited data available were generally weak for Japan and France but somewhat more mixed for western Germany. By contrast, economic activity appeared to be increasing in Canada and the United Kingdom.  Producer prices of finished goods were up in January and February after changing little over the fourth quarter. Producer prices of finished foods declined over the first two months of the year, but prices of finished energy products climbed rapidly, and prices of other finished items rose at a faster rate than in 1992. At the consumer level, price increases in January and February also were on the high side of the past year's advances. Food prices jumped in January and rose slightly further in February, while energy prices retraced most of a sharp January rise. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at a substantially faster pace over the January-February period than in 1992. Increases in wages, as measured by average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, remained subdued in recent months. The advance in average hourly earnings slowed in February, and the rise over the twelve months ended in February was considerably smaller than over the previous twelve-month period.  At its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with little change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period from January through March.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged only slightly above expected levels in the three full reserve maintenance periods in the intermeeting interval. For the period as a whole, the federal funds rate remained close to the 3 percent level that had prevailed in previous months.  Other short-term interest rates changed little over the intermeeting period, while long-term rates fell appreciably on balance. Bond markets rallied over most of the period, reflecting market assessments of improved prospects for significant reductions in the federal budget deficit in coming years and the consequences for overall spending. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds also were boosted by municipal defeasance activity and by perceptions of heightened prepayment risks in mortgage-backed securities. In early March, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds and conventional fixed-rate mortgages reached their lowest levels since 1973, but some of the decline in bond and mortgage rates subsequently was reversed in response to increased apprehension about inflation. Equity prices generally responded favorably to the drop in long-term interest rates, but concerns about future changes in government policy toward a number of industries, including health care, led to lower prices in some segments of the equities market.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated through late February, partly in response to declines in U.S. long-term interest rates and incoming data that were seen as pointing to some slowing of the expansion in the United States. Subsequently, the dollar rebounded in the wake of unexpectedly strong U.S. employment statistics, disappointing inflation numbers, and further signs of weakening economic activity abroad. Near the end of the period, the dollar again dropped against the German mark and other European currencies, following a cut by the Bundesbank of its discount rate that apparently was less than market participants were expecting. On balance over the period, the dollar was marginally lower against the mark and other European currencies, but it declined substantially against the Japanese yen, reaching an all-time low.  M2 and M3 contracted in January and February. Part of the weakness apparently reflected temporary factors, such as distortions in seasonal adjustment factors and a lull in prepayments of mortgage-backed securities that reduced deposits held in association with this activity. More fundamentally, relatively attractive returns on capital market instruments continued to prompt households to shift large amounts of liquid balances into market investments, such as bond and stock mutual fund shares. In addition, banks continued to issue subordinated debt and equity to improve their balance sheets at a time when the expansion of bank credit was slowing noticeably; in particular, bank lending to businesses had been depressed by paydowns from the proceeds of heavy bond and stock issuance by nonfinancial corporations. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have expanded somewhat further in January.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would grow over the year ahead at a pace that would foster a further gradual reduction in margins of unemployed labor and capital. The projection incorporated the essential elements of the fiscal proposals recently set forth by the Administration; the effects on aggregate demand, all other things equal, were expected to be small over the next several quarters. However, the appreciable declines in long-term interest rates that had occurred in recent months--evidently partly in response to anticipations of intermediate-term deficit reduction--were expected to support substantial additional gains in business and residential investment. Consumer spending would be bolstered by the progress already achieved in reducing debt service burdens and by a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security, although the higher personal income taxes now envisioned for upper-income taxpayers were expected to be an inhibiting factor. Increases in export demand would be limited in the near term by the continuing weakness in the economies of the major industrialized countries. The persisting slack in resource utilization was expected to be associated with a return to more subdued price increases after a spurt earlier this year.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, the members remained encouraged by recent developments that they viewed on the whole as tending to confirm their forecasts of sustained economic expansion, though at a pace appreciably below that now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1992. If realized, such economic growth would be associated over time with a further gradual decline in unemployment. While the expansion appeared to have generated some momentum, a number of factors were likely to limit its strength, including ongoing balance sheet and business restructuring activities, the outlook for a more restrictive federal budget, and continuing weakness in key foreign markets. At the same time, greatly reduced interest rates and much improved, if still vulnerable, business and consumer confidence were positive factors in the outlook. Some members cautioned that even though a moderate rate of economic growth could be viewed as the most likely outcome over the forecast horizon, the current expansion differed in important respects from earlier cyclical recoveries and in light of the attendant uncertainties a considerably different result--in either direction--could not be ruled out. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the faster increases in consumer prices in recent months and a sharp upturn in the prices of certain producer materials tended to raise concerns, or at least a degree of unease, with regard to underlying inflation trends. While these developments might well prove to be an aberration rather than a signal of intensifying inflation, they did suggest the need to reassess the likelihood of a further decline in inflation and to be alert to further signs of a sustained upturn. For now, however, the favorable trends in underlying unit labor costs, which were associated in turn with ongoing gains in productivity and the absence of any firming in wage pressures, led many members to conclude that recent price developments did not provide persuasive evidence of a change in the inflation outlook.  Members continued to report somewhat uneven business conditions across the nation. Steady economic growth characterized many parts of the country, but business activity remained depressed in some areas and industries, notably those related to defense, aerospace, and nonresidential construction. While business sentiment was generally positive, many business contacts were uncertain about the outlook for demand in their own industries or the potential strength of the overall expansion, and recent fiscal policy developments appeared to have introduced a further note of caution. This uncertainty helped to account for the continuing reliance of numerous firms on overtime work to meet growing demand rather than incurring the considerable costs of adding new workers. Even so, an increasing number of contacts were reporting worker recalls or new hires. One member commented that job growth could be viewed both as a measure of business sentiment and as a necessary element in building or maintaining consumer confidence and thus helping to ensure an enduring economic expansion.  The quickening recovery during 1992, especially in the second half of the year, had received considerable impetus from consumer spending, and while growth in such spending could be expected to moderate from its pace in recent quarters, the consumer sector was viewed as likely to play a key role in sustaining the expansion this year. Many consumers had taken advantage of steep declines in interest rates to strengthen their balance sheets and reduce their debt service burdens, and they were now in a much improved position to finance further growth in their expenditures. The members took note of recent indications of a decline in consumer confidence and of some softening in retail sales since early in the year. However, the latter appeared to be in part the result of recently adverse weather conditions in some major parts of the country, and consumer confidence was still much improved on balance since earlier in the recovery. Accordingly, recent developments were not seen in themselves as harbingers of a weakening consumer spending trend over the next several quarters.  Business spending on producers' durable equipment also was believed likely to continue to provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion assuming that the much reduced interest rates and currently favorable business attitudes would be sustained and that proposed investment tax credit legislation eventually would be enacted. At the same time, business spending for nonresidential structures probably would continue to be held back by weakness in office construction stemming from widespread overcapacity. While office building activity was likely to be restrained for an extended period, members saw some positive signs that pointed to a degree of stabilization in this sector, including the leveling out or even a marginal pickup in rents and occupancy rates in some markets that previously had been severely depressed. A slow turnaround in other building activity was reported in some regions, notably for industrial and retail structures.  While the available data on starts of single-family houses in January and February were somewhat disappointing, the members felt that housing construction activity had held up relatively well thus far this year, after allowing for the adverse weather conditions that had retarded construction in some areas. The greatly reduced cost of mortgage financing pointed to continuing gains in housing construction despite a rise in costs associated with the sharp jump in lumber prices and a scarcity of finished building lots in some areas.  The members agreed that the prospects for overall spending on business capital goods and housing were vulnerable to shifts in attitudes that might be triggered, for example, by increases in market interest rates associated with an absence of progress in reducing the federal budget deficit. The outlook for a significant contraction in the federal deficit was subject to considerable uncertainty, especially in light of the still pending decisions to be made with regard to health care programs and their financing. The members recognized that the direct effects of appreciable deficit reduction would tend to constrain economic activity, as evidenced by the impact in many areas of the defense cutbacks that were already being implemented. Business contacts had expressed concerns about the potential effects on their industries and local markets of various provisions in the proposed legislation. Even so, a more encompassing assessment of the effects of deficit reduction needed to take account of its favorable implications for domestic interest rates. Moreover, insofar as the nearer-term outlook was concerned, the fiscal legislation now under consideration included new spending initiatives and the investment tax credit that were intended to provide some temporary stimulus to an economic expansion that, in the view of many observers, might still be in the process of gathering sustainable momentum. On balance, substantial deficit reduction in line with the currently proposed legislation was seen as likely to have a positive effect on business and consumer confidence, financial markets, and the longer-term health of the economy.  Several members observed that the outlook for exports had worsened as a result of weakening economic trends in a number of major industrialized nations. Members also commented on the uncertainties in the outlook for foreign trade associated with a variety of political risks abroad and the persisting protectionism that currently was highlighted by strong opposition to key trade agreements now under negotiation or under consideration for ratification. Anecdotal information from business contacts involved in export markets continued to suggest lagging foreign demands for many U.S. goods; however, backlogs for other products, such as labor-saving capital equipment, remained sizable.  The members devoted considerable attention to the discussion of various factors underlying the outlook for inflation. The consumer and producer price indexes had been less favorable in January and February than in the latter part of 1992. Also, prices of various industrial and construction materials had firmed since the start of the year in apparent response to rising production and, in some industries, to import or environmental restrictions. Anecdotal reports of increasing costs and prices had begun to appear with somewhat greater frequency in some areas, and pressures to widen profit margins reportedly were strong in a number of industries. In their evaluation of recent inflation developments, however, the members generally gave more weight to the behavior of unit labor costs, which indicated that much of the economy's underlying cost structure did not reflect any signs of a pickup in inflationary pressures. Moreover, from a financial perspective, extensions of credit and growth in overall nonfinancial sector debt were not consistent with an economy that was generating significant inflationary pressures, and the recent behavior of long-term debt markets suggested expectations of more subdued inflation. Against this background, the recent upturn in consumer and certain commodity prices might well represent a temporary development such as had occurred previously during the current cyclical upswing. In support of this view, members cited various fundamentals that seemed inconsistent with accelerating inflation, including the considerable slack in the utilization of labor and capital resources, strong competitive conditions in many markets, the absence of significant lengthening in supplier delivery schedules, and an extended period of weak expansion in the broader monetary aggregates that now encompassed some recent deceleration in M1. Nonetheless, the members acknowledged that recent price developments had raised a degree of unease in their minds, and their concerns would rise if the recent pace of price advances were sustained in the months immediately ahead. One member observed that a somewhat faster economic expansion than currently was expected by most members might well serve to intensify inflation pressures. While price developments were notably difficult to predict, most of the members concluded that the evidence at this point did not confirm a resurgence in inflationary pressures, and some commented that further modest disinflation remained a reasonable expectation for the next several quarters.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, most of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions, while two members supported an immediate move to tighten reserve conditions. In the majority view, the current degree, of reserve pressure continued to represent a policy stance that was appropriately balanced in light of the opposing risks of a faltering economic expansion and a resurgence of inflation. Conditions in credit markets did not provide confirming evidence of the emergence of greater inflationary pressures and the need to restrain the growth in credit. Indeed, the continuation of balance sheet restructuring activities by financial institutions and the associated caution on the part of these institutions with regard to extending loans still appeared to be exerting a significantly inhibiting effect on the overall growth in spending and economic activity. Several members acknowledged that a policy of maintaining unchanged reserve conditions and an associated federal funds rate around current levels, which implied that real short-term rates were near zero or even slightly negative, could have inflationary consequences in the event of a strengthening of the expansion and a sustained pickup in credit demands. The Committee would need to remain alert to such a development. In present circumstances, however, an unchanged policy stance seemed most consistent with achieving sustained economic expansion in an environment of subdued inflation. The members who favored a prompt move toward restraint were persuaded that a steady policy incurred an unacceptable risk of halting the progress toward price stability and indeed of intensifying inflation as the current expansion matured. In this view, a policy tightening move at this point was likely to counter the need for more substantial and potentially disruptive tightening actions later.  In the course of the Committee discussion, the members took account of a staff analysis that pointed to a resumption of M2 and M3 growth over the months ahead. This analysis suggested that the temporary factors depressing the broader monetary aggregates likely would be reversing, but that the other influences causing a rechanneling of credit flows away from depository institutions and boosting the velocity of money undoubtedly would persist, though probably with diminishing force. Accordingly, the staff foresaw moderate growth of M2 and M3 that at midyear would leave these aggregates below the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for 1993. Under prevailing circumstances, such continuing weakness in the broader aggregates was not viewed as indicating inadequate monetary stimulus. Indeed, a number of members commented that other indicators suggested that current monetary policy was in fact quite accommodative as evidenced for example by low short-term interest rates, especially on an inflation-adjusted basis. Moreover, Ml, reserves, and the monetary base had continued to expand in the first quarter, though at much reduced rates. One member commented that the slowdown in these narrower monetary measures, which he viewed as important indicators of the thrust of monetary policy, had favorable implications with regard to bringing inflation under control. The members agreed that the considerable uncertainty that continued to surround the outlook for broad money relative to spending implied that forming precise expectations for monetary growth over the months ahead was not feasible.  In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, members who favored an unchanged policy stance also expressed a preference for retaining the symmetry of the existing directive. Some observed that a policy change during the intermeeting period, if any, might well be in the direction of a tightening move. However, because there was no compelling case in the view of most members for such a move at this time and any intermeeting adjustment would be made in the light of emerging developments, a symmetric directive was warranted. In this connection, one member commented that, given the Committee's assessment of current economic and financial conditions, a tilt in the directive toward restraint would give a misleading indication of the Committee's current intentions. Members also noted that a change in policy, should one be called for by intermeeting developments, would represent a shift in the direction of policy and would be likely to have an especially pronounced impact on financial markets.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, a majority of the members indicated that they favored a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. These members also expressed a preference for a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with a resumption of moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the second quarter.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has increased at a more moderate pace in the early months of 1993 after expanding robustly in the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment registered a sharp increase in February following generally small advances in previous months, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down further to 7.0 percent. Industrial production continued to post solid gains in January and February. Retail sales increased somewhat further over the first two months of the year after a fourth-quarter surge. Housing starts slipped in early 1993 after registering sizable gains late last year. Incoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest a further brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was essentially unchanged in January from its average level in the fourth quarter, but both exports and imports were substantially lower. Increases in wages have remained subdued, but recent advances in consumer and producer prices have been larger than those recorded in the latter part of 1992.  Short-term interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting in early February while bond yields have fallen appreciably on balance. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 contracted in January and February, apparently reflecting transitory factors and further shifts into market investments. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded somewhat further in January.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are likely to persist during the year. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with a resumption of moderate growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Corrigan, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, McTeer, Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.  Votes against this action: Messrs. Angell and Lindsey.  Messrs. Angell and Lindsey indicated that their concerns about the outlook for inflation prompted them to favor an immediate move to tighten reserve conditions. In their view, such an action was desirable not only to arrest the possible emergence of greater inflation but especially to promote further disinflation. They were persuaded that monetary policy currently was overly accommodative as suggested by various indicators such as recent data on consumer and producer prices, the upswing in commodity prices, the low level of real short-term interest rates, and what in their judgment was a relatively depressed foreign exchange value of the dollar given the comparative strength of the U.S. economy and international interest rate trends. They noted that the current federal funds rate was probably not sustainable in the long term and that a tightening move at this time might well avoid the need for more sizable and potentially disruptive policy actions later.  Mr. Angell also emphasized the risks associated with any policy that did not firmly maintain a disinflationary trend. As he interpreted historical precedents, the typical result of a policy that tolerated some inflation was an eventual rise in inflation leading to permanently higher interest rates with adverse effects on economic activity. Indeed, he supported unpegging the federal funds rate to counter incipient price pressures showing through in commodity and finished goods prices. He believed that a clear signal of the Committee's commitment to price level stability would stabilize the price of gold along with the exchange value of the dollar and thereby provide a climate for further reductions in long-and intermediate-term interest rates. Such an approach to policy not only would assure a continuing disinflationary trend and eventual price stability, with very favorable implications for financial markets and economic growth, but it would in his view preclude an unsettling tendency for the debt markets to weaken every time newly available data appeared to suggest that economic growth was strengthening and that further monetary policy tightening actions therefore might be in the offing. In sum, such a policy would provide for the achievement of the Committee's objective of sustaining progress toward price stability which he believed was necessary for maintaining recent higher labor productivity, a permanently higher savings rate, and a prolonged period of economic expansion.",199303,0,312,1993-03-31,-0.16,-0.23,-0.15,-0.11,-0.66,0.01,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1993-03-23

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the pace of the economic expansion had slowed in recent months. Business outlays for durable equipment had remained strong, but consumer spending had been quite sluggish, reflecting limited gains in employment and real labor income and diminished optimism about near-term economic prospects. Additionally, U.S. exports continued to be constrained by the disappointing performance of the major foreign industrial economies. Available data indicated relatively modest growth in payroll employment and industrial production over recent months. Despite the considerable slack in the economy, increases in wages and prices had been appreciably larger thus far in 1993 than in the second half of last year.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose only slightly on balance over March and April after registering sizable increases in the first two months of the year. Strong job gains in the services industry, notably in business and health services, were offset in considerable measure by job losses in manufacturing and construction in March and April. In manufacturing, reductions in payrolls were widespread, with particularly large declines at manufacturers of transportation equipment. Construction employment recovered only partially in April from the weather-related decline in March. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent.  Industrial production, after having posted solid gains in previous months, was little changed in March and April. Part of the recent sluggishness reflected a decline in utility output following a weather-related runup in February, but manufacturing output also grew more slowly. In the transportation industry, motor vehicle assemblies edged down and production of civilian aircraft remained weak over March and April. Elsewhere, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was about unchanged, and the continuing strength in the computer industry contrasted with sluggish production of other types of business equipment. Total utilization of industrial capacity changed little over the two months.  Retail sales increased substantially in April, reversing the weather-related decline in March; automotive dealers reported large sales gains in April, and expenditures at other retail outlets retraced part of the March decrease. For the year to date, however, retail sales had been lackluster after the strong increases of the latter part of 1992. Housing starts picked up in April; both single-family and multifamily starts rebounded from weather-depressed March levels.  Business fixed investment advanced further during the first quarter of 1993, with another sizable rise in outlays for equipment outweighing continued weakness in nonresidential construction. Shipments of nondefense capital goods during the first quarter were paced by another sharp increase in shipments of office and computing equipment. By contrast, business spending for transportation equipment generally exhibited little strength; although sales of heavy trucks continued to trend up, outlays for complete aircraft apparently edged down further. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods other than aircraft suggested further expansion in business spending for equipment in the near term. Nonresidential construction activity was mixed in the first quarter. Office construction declined considerably further in response to the depressing effects of a continuing overhang of unoccupied space. On the other hand, building activity in the public utilities sector continued to trend up, and the construction of commercial structures other than office buildings increased for a second consecutive quarter.  Business inventories appeared to have risen in the first quarter. Manufacturing inventories expanded in both February and March after a series of declines that began early in the fall; much of the recent advance occurred in the durable goods sector, where shipments were strong, and the ratio of inventories to shipments fell for manufacturing as a whole. Wholesale inventories increased appreciably in March. However, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector moved up only slightly, and it remained near the low end of its range over the past two years. In the retail sector, available data indicated that inventories rose appreciably over January and February but that the inventory-to-sales ratio remained in the narrow range that had prevailed over the preceding year.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in February was unchanged from its January level, reflecting little change in total exports and total imports. For January-February combined, however, the trade deficit was slightly below its average level for the fourth quarter, with both exports and imports down considerably from their fourth-quarter levels. Much of the drop in exports reflected a reversal of an earlier, largely transitory runup in aircraft and automotive products. The decline in imports was spread across all major trade categories; imports of aircraft and miscellaneous industrial supplies dropped appreciably, and imports of consumer goods fell further. Recent indicators pointed to further weakness in economic activity in continental Europe and Japan through the first quarter. Elsewhere, the recovery in the United Kingdom appeared to be firming, and growth continued at a modest pace in Canada.  Producer prices of finished goods rose more rapidly in March and April, partly as a result of sharp increases in the prices of finished energy goods in March and in the prices of finished foods in April. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices advanced over the first four months of 1993 at a faster pace than in 1992. At the consumer level, the increase in prices of nonfood, non-energy items over the March-April period was smaller than the outsized change over the first two months of the year; nevertheless, averaging over the first four months of the year, the rate of increase in consumer prices was higher than in 1992. The deceleration of labor costs also appeared to have stalled in 1993. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers had grown more rapidly thus far this year than in 1992, and total hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at a faster pace in the first quarter of 1993 than in any quarter of last year.  At its meeting on March 23, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with a resumption of moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the second quarter.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Expected levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing were raised during the period in anticipation of some increase in seasonal borrowing. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was near or a little above expected levels, except for a surge at the end of the first quarter, and the federal funds rate remained close to the 3 percent level that had prevailed for an extended period.  Short-term interest rates changed little over the period since the March meeting. Long-term rates rose considerably early in the period when a sharp increase in average hourly earnings and some upward pressure on commodity prices sparked fears among market participants of a buildup in inflation pressures. Subsequently, despite growing doubts about the fate of the deficit reduction program, bond yields declined in response to a series of more favorable readings on price behavior and to indications of a slowing of the economic expansion. Adverse news about consumer and producer prices rekindled inflation concerns late in the period, and bond rates once again moved higher. On balance, most long-term market rates rose somewhat over the period. Despite unexpectedly favorable earnings reports for many firms, major indexes of stock prices were narrowly mixed over the period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated considerably more against the Japanese yen than against the German mark. A variety of factors contributed to the dollar's weakness, including indications of renewed sluggishness in U.S. economic activity, diminished prospects for a fiscal stimulus package, and market perceptions over much of the intermeeting period of limited official support for concerted actions to support the dollar against the yen. After falling to a historical low against the yen in late April, the dollar tended to stabilize following Treasury Secretary Bentsen's clarification of the Administration's exchange rate policy and intervention purchases of dollars against yen in a coordinated operation. Later in the period, the dollar rose somewhat against European currencies as the outlook for economic activity in Europe became more pessimistic.  M2 contracted slightly on balance over March and April, while M3 was unchanged over the two months; both monetary aggregates increased substantially in early May. Much of the weakness in M2 over the March-April period owed to a smaller volume of nonwithheld tax payments in April of this year that reduced the need for a buildup in deposits to fund these payments. Abstracting from this temporary depressant, weak underlying growth in M2 continued to reflect the relatively attractive returns available on capital market instruments such as bond and stock mutual funds, which experienced heavy inflows during the two-month period. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through March.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would grow at a moderate pace and that such growth would foster a gradual reduction in margins of unemployed labor and capital. The projection continued to incorporate the essential elements of the Administration's fiscal package, excluding that portion of the short-run stimulus initiative that seemed unlikely to be enacted by the Congress. Although the outlook for fiscal policy now seemed somewhat more contractionary than earlier, the sizable declines in long-term interest rates that had occurred in recent months were expected to support substantial additional gains in business and residential investment. Moreover, the increasingly favorable financial environment associated with expected further easing of credit supply constraints and the ongoing strengthening of balance sheets would tend to buttress private spending on housing, consumer durables, and business equipment. Increases in export demand would be damped in the near term by the continuing weakness in the economies of the major industrialized countries. The persisting slack in resource utilization was expected to be associated with a return to more subdued price increases after a spurt earlier in the year.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, the members focused with some concern on the evidence of a slower economic expansion and a higher rate of inflation since late 1992. While recent indicators of economic activity were disappointing, the expansion nonetheless appeared to have sustainable momentum and the members generally viewed moderate growth in line with, or perhaps a bit below, their February forecasts as a reasonable expectation. At the same time, several emphasized that the outlook was subject to substantial uncertainty stemming to an important extent from the unsettled course of legislation aimed at reducing the federal deficit. Members expressed particular concern about the rise in various measures of inflation over the past several months. The increase seemed to reflect temporary factors and a worsening in inflationary expectations rather than any significant change in economic fundamentals. Accordingly, it was premature in the view of many members to conclude that the inflationary trend had tilted upward. Even so, higher inflation expectations, if sustained, would be detrimental to economic performance, and the risks of an uptrend in inflation clearly had increased.  In their review of business developments across the nation, members continued to report uneven conditions ranging from apparently moderate gains in some parts of the country to mixed or marginally declining activity in others. Business confidence had deteriorated in many areas and firms were trimming or putting on hold new or expanded spending programs pending a resolution of federal tax and spending proposals, including prospective health care reform, and the outcome of proposed tax legislation in some states as well. Cautious business attitudes were reflected in continuing efforts to constrain costs and to hold down or reduce employment levels, notably of permanent workers in light of the large non-wage costs associated with full-time workers. Accordingly, while some job growth was occurring, especially outside major firms and the defense sector, business firms generally appeared disposed to continue to meet increases in demand through overtime work and temporary workers, and members anticipated that such attitudes were likely to persist in the absence of a major improvement in business confidence.  As reflected in the available data for the national economy, anecdotal reports from around the country suggested generally lackluster retail sales over the first four months of the year. To an extent, this development probably involved some retrenchment in consumer spending following an unsustainable surge during the latter part of 1992. In some parts of the country, unusually severe weather conditions also had served to hold down retail sales earlier this year and recovery from that slowdown had tended to be limited thus far, especially outside the automotive sector. Looking ahead, the members continued to anticipate that consumer spending would provide moderate support for a sustained economic expansion.  Despite the cautious business attitudes about the economic outlook, spending for business equipment had continued to help maintain the expansion. Encouraged in part by relatively low interest rates, receptive financial markets, and the more aggressive lending policies of some depository institutions, many firms were upgrading equipment to reduce costs and improve their product offerings. Concurrently, however, numerous firms reported that they were holding off on making major new investment commitments and in some cases were revising down earlier expansion plans in light of prevailing economic uncertainties, notably those generated by the current legislative debate about federal taxes and spending. Nonresidential construction remained uneven and on the whole relatively subdued across the nation. The construction of new office structures was likely to stay depressed in much of the country as overcapacity continued to be worked down, but members saw indications of some strengthening in industrial and commercial building activity and in public works projects in some areas.  Turning to the outlook for the nation's trade balance, some members referred to quite gloomy assessments from business contacts and other sources regarding current economic conditions in a number of major industrial nations and the associated prospect of little or no growth in U.S. exports to such countries. While total U.S. exports might continue to expand, reflecting sizable gains in some parts of the world, imports probably would grow at a somewhat faster pace, given moderate expansion in domestic demand in line with the members' expectations. At the same time, members expressed concern about the potential impact of growing protectionist sentiment on current trade negotiations and on the longer-run outlook for domestic industries and parts of the country that relied on foreign trade.  With regard to the inflation situation, members commented that it remained difficult to find a satisfactory explanation for the faster-than-projected increases in price measures thus far this year. Although temporary anomalies seemed to be involved, including measurement problems and special factors boosting some prices, higher inflation expectations also might have been playing a key role. The latter seemed to have intensified in the last month or two, perhaps as a result of growing concerns that significant deficit-reduction legislation might not be enacted. Strong competitive pressures in many markets, including competition from foreign producers, still appeared to be restraining or precluding price increases by many business firms, but efforts to raise prices seemed to be encountering somewhat less resistance recently than earlier in the economic expansion. Some price increases appeared to be associated with the earlier surge in demand, and in the case of one key industry higher prices had been facilitated by the implementation of import restrictions. The downtrend in labor compensation inflation also seemed to have stalled in recent months. Against this background, a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for inflation and the members differed to some extent with regard to the most likely outcome. A number of members, while they did not rule out the possibility of a more favorable result, stressed the risk that a faster rate of inflation might well tend to be sustained. Others gave more emphasis to the still considerable slack in labor and product markets and to the restrained growth in broad measures of money and credit. In this view, an inflation rate in the quarters ahead more in line with their earlier forecasts was still a reasonable expectation even though the average rate for the year as a whole was likely to be higher than they had forecast at the start of the year.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, many of the members commented that recent price and wage developments were troubling but did not point persuasively at this juncture toward an extended period of higher inflation. In light of underlying economic and financial conditions, the upturn in inflation expectations and the somewhat quickened pace of inflation might well prove to be temporary. The economy was expanding, but the pace had slowed in recent months. On the other hand, the potential for a sustained increase in the rate of inflation could not be dismissed. Waiting too long to counter any emerging uptrend in inflation or further worsening in inflationary expectations would exacerbate inflationary pressures and require more substantial and more disruptive policy moves later. Indeed, in one view sensitive commodity prices and other key measures of inflation already indicated the need for a prompt move toward restraint, especially in the context of the Committee's objective of fostering progress toward price stability. However, the other members all supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions at this time.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, the members took account of a staff analysis that pointed to a considerable pickup in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months of May and June. Such strengthening, which appeared to have emerged in early May, was associated in part with the reversal of earlier tax-related distortions and with a surge in prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Monetary growth was expected to revert to a more modest pace over subsequent months, and the members recognized that in any event the interpretation of monetary growth rates needed to be approached with considerable caution in a period when traditional relationships of such growth to aggregate measures of economic performance were not reliable. In present circumstances, M2 and M3 no longer seemed to be good barometers of underlying liquidity, which appeared to be ample. One member expressed the view that the relatively robust growth of M1 and reserves served as a better indicator of the thrust of monetary policy than did the broader monetary aggregates.  In the view of a majority of the members, wage and price developments over recent months were sufficiently worrisome to warrant positioning policy for a move toward restraint should signs of intensifying inflation continue to multiply. In addition to new information on prices and costs, such signs could include developments in markets affected by inflation psychology, such as those for bonds, foreign exchange, and sensitive commodities, all of which would need to be monitored carefully. These members supported a directive that incorporated a greater predilection to tighten than to ease over the intermeeting period. Given the special nature of current inflation concerns and attendant uncertainties, however, the Committee agreed with a proposal by the Chairman that an intermeeting consultation would be appropriate in the event that a tightening move were to be contemplated during this period. If a policy tightening action were not needed, an asymmetric directive would nonetheless underscore the Committee's concern about recent inflation readings and its judgment that a policy to encourage progress toward price stability would promote sustained economic growth. In the event that a tightening action became necessary, such action could help to moderate inflationary expectations, with positive implications over time for long-term interest rates and the performance of the economy. Monetary policy would still be stimulative after a modest tightening move in that such a move would leave short-term interest rates close to or even below their year-ago levels in real terms, given the interim rise in inflation.  Some members preferred to retain a directive that did not incorporate a presumption about the likely direction of a change in policy, if any, during the intermeeting period. They were concerned that adopting a biased directive might prove to be an overreaction to temporary factors and to a short-lived upturn in inflationary sentiment that was not warranted by underlying economic conditions. They noted that, if called for by intermeeting developments, a move toward restraint could be implemented from a symmetric directive. More fundamentally, they believed that the circumstances surrounding the recent performance of the economy and the uncertainties about price developments suggested the need for considerable caution before any policy tightening was implemented and that such a policy move should be carried out only in the light of information that pointed clearly to the emergence of higher inflation. Nonetheless, all but one of these members could accept an asymmetric directive on the understanding that the Committee would have a chance to discuss any possible policy action.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two of the members indicated that they preferred or could accept a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with appreciable growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economic expansion has slowed in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose only slightly over March and April after registering sizable increases earlier in the year, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent. Industrial production was little changed in March and April after posting solid gains in previous months. Retail sales increased substantially in April but were about unchanged on balance for the year to date. Housing starts picked up in April. Incoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest a further brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January-February was slightly below its average level in the fourth quarter. Increases in wages and prices have been appreciably larger this year than in the second half of 1992.  Short-term interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting on March 23 while bond yields have risen somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period.  After contracting during the first quarter, M2 was unchanged in April while M3 turned up; both aggregates increased substantially in early May. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through March.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are likely to persist during the year. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with appreciable growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Corrigan, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, McTeer, Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.  Votes against this action: Messrs. Angell and Boehne.  Mr. Angell dissented because he believed that the persisting indications of rising inflation and the related deterioration in inflationary psychology called for a prompt move to tighten monetary policy. In his view, low real interest rates, a very steep yield curve, a surprisingly weak exchange value of the dollar along with the confirming price behavior of inflation-sensitive commodities such as gold underscored the need for Committee action to signal the System's continuing commitment to the eventual achievement of price stability. In his opinion, progress toward lower inflation was not likely in 1993 and 1994 in the absence of a monetary policy that was sufficiently restrictive to check inflationary expectations. He added that history demonstrated that a monetary policy focused primarily on developments in the real economy ran the risk of waiting too long to counter a worsening in inflationary expectations and thus requiring more substantial and possibly more disruptive policy changes later.  Mr. Boehne supported a steady policy course, but he dissented because he objected to a directive that was biased toward tightening. Although recent developments suggested that inflation would be somewhat higher and real growth somewhat lower during the year than had been expected earlier, he did not believe recent data indicated a fundamental shift in the outlook for inflation or the economy. He was concerned that adopting a biased directive might prove to be an overreaction to temporary factors affecting the inflation rate and inflationary sentiment. In his view, underlying economic conditions did not point toward an extended period of higher inflation. While the pace of economic growth conceivably could quicken, it seemed just as likely that the tempo of business and consumer spending could diminish in the face of uncertainty about the stance of fiscal policy, particularly with regard to potential tax increases. Given these uncertainties, he had a strong preference for keeping an open mind about possible Committee action during the intermeeting period and, accordingly, favored a balanced policy directive.",199305,0,314,1993-05-31,-0.22,0.21,-0.01,-0.04,-0.05,-0.13,-0.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1993-05-18

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting provided a mixed reading on the economy, but on balance the available data suggested that the expansion had picked up somewhat during the second quarter from the very slow pace of the first quarter. Employment statistics, while tending to soften in June, pointed to considerable strength for the second quarter as a whole, although recent spending indicators suggested a much more moderate expansion. Consumer and producer price inflation slowed substantially in May, but prices had risen at a faster rate over the first five months of the year than over the second half of 1992.  Total nonfarm payroll employment changed little in June after registering substantial gains in April and May. For the second quarter as a whole, the increase in employment matched that of the first quarter. Manufacturing employment, which was about unchanged over the first quarter, declined somewhat in June for a third straight month. Construction payrolls edged lower after rising appreciably over the preceding two months, and job gains in the services industries were considerably smaller in June than those recorded earlier in the year. The civilian unemployment rate backed up to 7.0 percent in June.  Industrial production increased in May at the relatively subdued rate recorded in March and April; for June, the limited data available suggested a modest decline in output. In May, assemblies of motor vehicles declined after holding steady over the two previous months. Among other manufactured goods, the production of business equipment, led by computers and industrial equipment, recorded another brisk advance whereas the output of non-auto consumer goods continued to expand sluggishly. Total utilization of industrial capacity was unchanged in May for a third straight month.  Real personal consumption expenditures edged higher in May after a sizable rebound in April from weather-related weakness. On balance, however, consumer spending had increased only slightly thus far this year. Outlays for new cars and light trucks advanced in May to their highest level since January 1990 and apparently remained near that elevated level in June. In addition, spending for non-energy services had increased substantially in recent months. By contrast, energy consumption had fallen from the especially high levels of late winter, and outlays for nondurable goods in May were still below their fourth-quarter level. Housing starts increased in April and May from a depressed first-quarter pace, with most of the rise attributable to starts of single-family dwellings.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods in May retraced only a portion of a sizable April decline. However, for the two months combined, shipments of such goods were above the average for the first quarter and apparently remained on an upward trend that began early in 1992. The upward trajectory for spending on machinery and on electrical and communications equipment seemed to have reflected improved cash flows for the business sector and a declining cost of capital, and incoming data suggested that outlays for business equipment would increase further over the months ahead. Nonresidential construction activity was unchanged over the first quarter but picked up slightly on balance over April and May. Office building rose over the two months, while construction of non-office commercial structures was little changed and industrial building activity was down sharply.  Business inventories recorded another appreciable rise in April, and available data pointed to a further increase in May. In manufacturing, inventory accumulation stepped up in April and May after changing little in the first quarter: the ratio of stocks to shipments edged higher in each month and was only slightly above the very low level reached early in 1993. In the wholesale trade sector, inventories advanced at a slower rate in May than in April, and the inventory-to-sales ratio fell to the low end of the range for the past three years. The buildup of retail inventories slowed considerably in April, and with sales rebounding from the effect of March storms, the inventory-to-sales ratio declined for the retail sector. Nonetheless, the ratio still was near the high end of its range for the past several years.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for April was unchanged from March, with both imports and exports declining slightly. However, the April deficit was substantially above the average for the first quarter, reflecting sizable increases in imports of capital goods, automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The value of exports in April was only slightly above the first-quarter average. Recent indicators pointed to further weakness in economic activity in continental Europe thus far this year. By contrast, economic recovery appeared to be continuing in the United Kingdom and Canada. In Japan, economic activity was up appreciably in the first quarter, but available data suggested that this strength had not carried over to the second quarter.  Changes in producer and consumer prices were small in May following sizable increases earlier in the year. Producer prices of finished goods were unchanged in May, as declines in prices of finished consumer food and energy products offset small advances in prices of other finished goods. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices had risen more rapidly thus far in 1993 than they had in the second half of 1992. At the consumer level, prices of items other than food and energy rose only slightly in May, but this measure of inflation also had risen faster this year than in the second half of last year. Labor costs likewise had evidenced a quickened pace of increases this year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose substantially in May after edging lower in April, and these earnings had grown more rapidly over the first five months of 1993 than over the preceding six months.  At its meeting on May 18, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a tilt toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with appreciable growth of the broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. Several upward adjustments were made to expected levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing during the period in anticipation of stepped-up demand for seasonal credit during the crop-growing season: borrowing averaged near expected levels over the period. The federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent over the period, although quarter-end pressures in money markets pushed the rate higher for a brief period at the end of June.  Other short-term interest rates also were little changed on balance over the period since the May meeting. Early in the period, unexpectedly robust employment data for May, coupled with media reports about the monetary policy stance adopted at the May meeting, led to some upward pressure on money market interest rates. Subsequently, however, this pressure abated in response to the release of data suggesting slower inflation and a somewhat weaker outlook for the economy. These developments along with the progress in the Congress toward adoption of a deficit-reduction package fostered a decline in bond yields: buoyed by the drop in yields, major indexes of stock prices rose over the intermeeting period in spite of disappointing second-quarter earnings reports by several major companies.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased on balance over the intermeeting period. After depreciating somewhat through the end of May, the dollar recovered in early June when U.S. money market interest rates moved higher. The dollar rose more strongly over the last half of June, principally in response to actual and expected monetary easing abroad. The rise in the dollar over the intermeeting interval reflected sizable appreciations against European currencies, especially the German mark. The dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen through the middle of June, in the process setting several new lows, before recovering a little over the remainder of the period.  After contracting during the first quarter, M2 and M3 expanded appreciably over the second quarter. Most of this growth, which was especially pronounced in May, reflected strength in Ml and occurred despite continued heavy outflows to bond and equity funds. The May surge resulted in part from a strong pickup in mortgage refinancing activity and a reversal of the depressing effect in April of relatively damped individual nonwithheld tax payments on the seasonally adjusted level of liquid deposits. The growth of the broader aggregates moderated substantially in June, and by more than might have been suggested by the waning of these mortgage and tax influences. For the year through June, growth of both M2 and M3 was below the lower ends of the ranges for 1993 that the Committee had established in February. This sluggishness reflected ongoing changes in asset preferences and financing patterns rather than restrictive financial conditions. The velocity of M2 was estimated to have increased at a rate of about 4-1/2 percent over the first half of the year after a 4 percent rise in 1992. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through April.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested moderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital through 1994. The projection assumed the enactment of a federal budget bill that implied a moderately restrictive fiscal policy over the forecast horizon. As in earlier staff projections, lower interest rates were expected to support appreciable gains in interest-sensitive expenditures, including housing, consumer durables, and business equipment. Private spending also would be buttressed by a favorable financial environment associated with strengthened balance sheets and reduced debt burdens and by the apparently increasing willingness of banking institutions to make new loans. Export demand was likely to remain constrained over the near term by the weakness in the economies of several major industrial countries, but some improvement in foreign demand was anticipated later as those economies started to strengthen. The outlook for moderate growth and continuing slack in resource utilization suggested considerably more subdued price increases than had occurred in the early months of 1993.  In the Committee's discussion, the members generally agreed that ongoing economic developments remained consistent with moderate but sustained growth in economic activity. No sector of the economy seemed poised at this juncture to provide strong impetus to the expansion, but a promising basis for further growth was seen in the much improved financial condition of many households and business firms. Lower long-term interest rates, which had contributed to the improvement in balance sheets, were likely as well to bolster housing and business capital spending more directly. While the expansion now appeared to be firmly established, a number of members cautioned that it was subject to some downside risks, notably those associated with the still uncertain outlook for government budget and other policies. The possibility of higher taxes, associated with the deficit reduction legislation currently under consideration in the Congress and with the forthcoming proposals for national health care reform, was widely reported to be damping spending. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the most recent data on prices offered some encouragement that the earlier upturn in key measures of inflation might prove to be temporary, especially in the context of still ample margins of unutilized labor and other production resources. Even so, given generally held expectations among the public that inflation was not likely to decline and might in fact trend higher, many members concluded that for now the disinflationary trend might have been arrested or, at least, that further progress toward price stability would be quite difficult to achieve over the next several quarters.  In conformance with the usual practice at meetings when the Committee considers its longer-run objectives for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1993 and 1994. In light of the experience in the first half of the year, forecasts of real growth in 1993 had been revised down somewhat since February, while projections of inflation had been raised. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1993 was now 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 percent for the year as a whole; for 1994, these projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts converged on growth rates of 5 to 5-3/4 percent for 1993 and 5 to 6-1/2 percent for 1994. Given the projections of a moderate uptrend in economic activity and expectations of some further gains in labor productivity, the forecasts incorporated only a small decline in unemployment to rates of around 6-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993 and only slightly lower by the fourth quarter of 1994. For the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent in 1993 and 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 1994, reflecting little change in both years from the rate of inflation experienced in 1992.  Members commented that the improved prospects for significant reductions in the federal deficit had played an important role in fostering the declines in longer-term interest rates that had occurred since the latter part of 1992: the lower rates were having positive effects on spending decisions in a number of interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as well as on balance sheets more generally. At the same time, the prospects for higher taxes--accentuated by uncertainties about their size and incidence--were widely reported to be inhibiting spending decisions by business firms and might also be adding to cautious consumer attitudes. Some of the anecdotal evidence suggested that uncertainties associated with the potential impact of the still unannounced proposals for health care reform were making many businesses especially cautious, notably in their hiring decisions. Adding to the effects of anticipated federal legislation were concerns in various parts of the country about further cuts in defense spending and the impact of additional reductions in state and local expenditures or of increases in state and local taxes. Some members observed that the fiscal policy legislation before the Congress appeared to have generated a perhaps exaggerated degree of concern, and passage of this legislation might have a generally favorable effect on business and consumer sentiment.  Turning to the outlook for individual sectors of the economy, members referred to indications of an upturn in consumer spending in recent months, but they also noted that survey results and anecdotal reports still suggested generally cautious consumer attitudes. The prospects for increased taxes might be having some negative effect on consumer confidence, but consumers remained especially concerned about the outlook for jobs and incomes as defense cutbacks continued and many firms, notably larger business establishments, took further steps to restructure and downsize their operations. To an important extent the improvement in retail sales in the second quarter was associated with stronger sales of motor vehicles that, in the view of at least some members, appeared to reflect previously postponed replacement demand rather than a major shift in consumer attitudes. In any event, moderate growth in consumer spending was likely to be maintained in the context of the improved financial condition and the related reduction in debt-service burdens of many households. Further growth in overall employment, in line with that achieved in the first half of the year, would if it persisted provide important support toward sustaining the expansion of consumer spending and thus the growth of the economy more generally.  With regard to the outlook for business fixed investment, members reported that many firms were scaling back or putting on hold their capital spending plans pending a resolution of the business tax proposals under consideration in the Congress. Nonetheless, business spending for equipment still constituted a relatively robust sector of the economy, at least according to the data available to date. To a considerable extent, such spending reflected ongoing efforts to improve the quality of products and the efficiency of business operations while holding down the number of employees, and the members saw this trend as likely to continue. In general, other business capital spending had remained sluggish, although construction activity other than office building appeared to have picked up in parts of the country. The prospects for housing construction, though not ebullient, were viewed as more promising particularly in light of the declines in mortgage interest rates to relatively low levels. The improved financial position of many potential homebuyers also provided a basis for anticipating stronger housing markets. Despite these favorable factors, however, overall housing activity had improved only modestly in recent months as homebuyers tended to remain cautious, and at least in some areas housing developers continued to report that they were encountering difficulties in securing construction finance. On balance, housing construction seemed likely to provide some impetus to the expansion in coming quarters.  Relatively weak economic conditions in a number of foreign industrial countries were likely to continue to limit U.S. exports, which had declined since the end of 1992. Indeed, available data supplemented by reports from a variety of contacts suggested that business conditions had remained quite weak or had worsened in a number of foreign industrial nations. Even so, business contacts in some parts of the United States indicated that foreign demand for their products was still quite robust. Business activity abroad, which already was trending higher in a few industrial nations, was viewed as likely to strengthen more generally over the year ahead, with positive effects on overall U.S. exports.  Turning to the outlook for inflation, members commented that despite favorable readings recently, a wide range of price and wage data had suggested some acceleration in the rate of inflation during the early months of the year. To some extent, the indications of intensified inflation might have been the result of difficulties with seasonal adjustments or other temporary factors, but there were reports of some successful efforts by business firms to raise prices following the spurt in demand and the rise in capacity utilization toward the end of 1992. These price developments were disappointing and suggested to many members that the disinflationary trend might have been arrested, at least for now, though the economic fundamentals remained consistent with a resumption of some further downward movement in the rate of inflation. With regard to those fundamentals, many members saw significant, albeit diminished, slack in labor and product markets as likely to persist over the forecast horizon, given their current forecasts of moderate expansion in economic activity. Other favorable-factors in the inflation outlook included efforts by businesses to hold down costs and increase productivity by restructuring their operations and investing in new, more productive equipment. Unfortunately, these favorable elements in the underlying economic situation seemed at odds with the apparently widely held view by the public that inflation would not diminish and indeed was likely to increase and that in any event current inflation levels were tolerable. Such expectations and attitudes would tend to temper the gains against inflation, if any, over the forecast horizon by their effects on the pricing and wage behavior of business firms and employees and the reactions of consumers toward rising prices. This inflationary climate underscored the importance of credible government policies--monetary, fiscal, trade, and regulatory--that encouraged reduced inflation over time.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the period until the next meeting, most of the members indicated that they saw little or no reason to change monetary policy in either direction. The most recent information on the performance of the economy was mixed, and this together with questions about the course of fiscal policy contributed to considerable uncertainty about the outlook. Even so, the members felt that the evidence pointed on the whole to a sustained rate of economic expansion. The latest price statistics provided some encouragement that the apparent intensification of inflation in earlier months of the year might have abated. For now, therefore, nearly all the members saw the balance of factors bearing on the course of economic activity and the outlook for inflation as calling for an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions.  According to a staff analysis prepared for this meeting, the growth of M2 could be expected to slow markedly in the months ahead from its pace over the second quarter. The projected deceleration was mainly associated with some unwinding of the second-quarter bulge in mortgage refinancings along with further heavy inflows to bond and stock mutual funds. The expansion of M3 appeared likely to be held down by weaker bank credit extensions as alternative sources of funds in the capital markets attracted more borrowers. On balance, modest growth of both M2 and M3 would keep them close to the lower ends of their downward-revised ranges through September.  Some members cautioned that despite the very sluggish behavior of the broad measures of money thus far this year, monetary policy was relatively expansive as evidenced by a variety of other indicators including the growth in narrow measures of money and reserves and the very low levels of money market interest rates. Indeed, in the view of several members, in a period characterized by indications of some worsening in inflationary expectations, a policy course that maintained steady conditions in reserve markets could be said to have become more accommodative as the federal funds rate, in real terms after adjustment for expected inflation, moved down from an already low level. Accordingly, while current monetary policy seemed likely to support further economic-expansion, the Committee needed to remain alert to the potential for intensifying inflation. At some point the current policy stance could well begin to foster greater price pressures. One member urged a prompt move toward restraint, given the prospect in his view that further progress toward price stability was unlikely with the current, quite stimulative, stance of monetary policy.  A majority of the members, taking account of the current stance of monetary policy, favored a proposal to retain the bias toward possible tightening that the Committee had adopted at the May meeting. In this connection, some commented that while the need for any policy adjustment during the period ahead seemed somewhat remote, the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. Other members suggested that a symmetrical directive might be more consistent with current economic conditions and the related outlook for a steady policy course over the near term. These members agreed, however, that a return to symmetry so soon after the adoption of a directive that was biased toward restraint could convey a misleading impression that recent developments had increased the Committee's concerns about the sustainability of the expansion or that the Committee had become less committed to a disinflationary policy course. Accordingly, these members indicated that they could support an asymmetric directive at this point. Several members observed that a number of key economic measures were scheduled for release during the intermeeting period and that the data in question should provide a firmer basis for evaluating the performance of the economy and a desirable course for monetary policy.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they preferred or found acceptable a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a bias toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the third quarter.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economic expansion has picked up somewhat in recent months from the very slow pace of the first quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment changed little in June after registering substantial gains in April and May, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 7.0 percent in June. Industrial production has changed little on balance over the last few months. Real consumer expenditures edged higher in May after a sizable rise in April but have increased only slightly thus far this year. Housing starts turned up in April from a depressed first-quarter pace and rose somewhat further in May. Incoming data suggest a continued brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was about unchanged in April but substantially larger than its average rate in the first quarter. Consumer and producer prices were about unchanged in May, but for the year to date inflation has been more rapid than in the second half of 1992.  Short-term interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting on May 18 while bond yields have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased on balance over the intermeeting period.  After contracting during the first quarter, M2 and M3 expanded appreciably over the second quarter. For the year through June, growth of the two aggregates was below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for 1993. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through April.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting lowered the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases would persist over the balance of the year and that money growth within these lower ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the third quarter.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Mullins. Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey. McTeer, Oltman, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.  Vote against this action: Mr. Angell.  Absent: Mr. Corrigan. (Mr. Oltman voted as alternate for Mr. Corrigan.)  Mr. Angell dissented because he favored a prompt move to tighten policy. In his view, monetary policy was overly expansive at this point as evidenced by what he viewed as excessive liquidity in financial markets, the negative level of real short-term interest rates, and the disappointing lack of progress toward lower inflation this year. Given indications of worsening inflationary expectations, such as the substantial rise in the price of gold, as well as projections of an increase in inflation, a policy that led to a steady federal funds rate in fact implied a further easing of an already stimulative monetary policy. In these circumstances, a tightening of policy would not involve any significant risk to the expansion but would foster changes in financial conditions and the outlook for inflation that would be more consistent with renewed progress toward price stability in 1994 and later. Declining inflation around the world and a stronger trend of productivity growth in the United States, among other factors, were providing a favorable environment for further disinflation, but those developments needed to be supported and validated by appropriate monetary policy action.",199307,0,316,1993-07-31,0.06,0.16,0.02,-0.21,0.04,-0.02,-0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1993-07-07

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed by the Committee suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace. The limited data available for the third quarter presented a mixed picture but on balance pointed to continued expansion in consumption, business fixed investment, and homebuilding. Employment remained on an uptrend, and industrial production recently had firmed somewhat. After rising at a faster rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices had changed little and producer prices had fallen in recent months.  Total nonfarm payroll employment, after a small gain in June, expanded in July at a rate close to its average advance in earlier months of the year. The services industries, led by business services, provided half of the July increase. Elsewhere, considerable hiring was evident in wholesale and retail trade, and construction employment moved up after a small decline in June. In manufacturing, more jobs were lost, although at a slower rate than earlier in the year. The civilian unemployment rate dropped to 6.8 percent in July.  Industrial production recovered in July from small declines in May and June. Manufacturing output rose in spite of a sizable cutback in motor vehicle assemblies: utility production registered a strong weather-related gain; and mining output declined further. Within manufacturing, the production of consumer durable goods other than automobiles and trucks rebounded in July, and the output of business equipment advanced further. Total utilization of industrial capacity edged higher in July, reflecting a substantial gain at electric utilities: utilization of manufacturing capacity was unchanged.  Retail sales increased slightly further in July after a sizable rise in the second quarter. Spending on automobiles was down for a second straight month, but sales were strong at apparel, furniture and appliance, and general merchandise stores. Total housing starts, depressed by wet weather and floods in some areas of the country, were down somewhat in July; however, permit issuance moved up, suggesting that homebuilding activity remained in a mild uptrend. In addition, consumer surveys indicated that attitudes toward homebuying continued to be strongly positive during July, and builders' assessments of home sales improved substantially.  Business fixed investment increased in the second quarter at about the rapid pace of the first quarter. Business spending for equipment remained strong, with solid increases in business purchases of motor vehicles, computers, and a wide range of machinery and equipment. However, outlays for aircraft declined in the second quarter, retracing some of the substantial first-quarter rise. The limited information available for the third quarter pointed to some slowing of the growth of business spending for equipment. In the second quarter, nonresidential building activity posted its largest advance in three years. Expenditures were up across a broad array of categories, with investment in institutional and public utilities structures being particularly strong.  Business inventories expanded moderately during the second quarter, and inventory accumulation was broadly in line with sales over the first half of the year. In manufacturing, stocks edged lower in June, reflecting a further decline in inventories held by aircraft producers. Outside of the aircraft industry, inventory changes were mixed. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of inventories to shipments fell in June to one of the lowest levels in recent years. In the wholesale trade sector, inventories expanded modestly in June, and with sales lower, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector increased slightly. Retail inventories, after changing little in May, rose slightly more than sales in June, and the stocks-to-sales ratio for the retail sector remained near the high end of its range for the past several years.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was considerably smaller in May than the deficits recorded in March and April: however, the deficit for April and May combined was larger than the average rate for the first quarter. The value of exports rose slightly in May; increases in sales abroad of industrial supplies, machinery, and consumer goods offset declines in agricultural products, civilian aircraft, and motor vehicles and parts. A drop in the value of imports was spread across a wide range of products, particularly automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The economic performance of the major foreign industrial countries was mixed in the second quarter. Output continued to decline in western Germany, and economic activity in Japan appeared to have stalled after modest growth in the first quarter. In contrast, economic recovery continued in Canada and the United Kingdom.  Producer prices of finished goods declined in July for a second consecutive month. Prices of finished foods edged lower, and prices of finished energy goods, particularly gasoline and fuel oil fell significantly; excluding the food and energy components, producer prices edged up in July and to that point in the year had risen at a slightly lower rate than was recorded in 1992. At the consumer level, prices for nonfood, non-energy items were up slightly in both June and July and for the year to date had increased a little more slowly than last year. Hourly compensation for private industry workers rose in the second quarter at about the rate seen last year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged on balance over June and July, but for the year through July these earnings had increased at the same pace as in 1992.  At its meeting on July 6-7, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a tilt toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of the broader monetary aggregates over the third quarter.  Throughout the intermeeting period, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Two upward revisions were made to expected levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing in anticipation of further increases in demand for seasonal credit. Borrowing averaged close to expected levels over most of the intermeeting interval, and the federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent.  Money market interest rates were little changed on balance over the intermeeting period, while rates on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury obligations and on fixed-rate mortgages dropped slightly. Yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds were down by more, with the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond falling below 6-1/2 percent. Many market interest rates moved higher after Chairman Greenspan's congressional testimony on July 20, which was perceived by market participants as suggesting a greater likelihood of some tightening of monetary policy in the future. Subsequently, interest rates generally retreated in reaction to incoming economic data indicating subdued inflation pressures and to the passage of the deficit-reduction legislation. Major indexes of stock prices increased somewhat over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar strengthened slightly against the German mark, but it rose by significantly more against most other European currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the aftermath of a widening of the margins within which participating currencies are allowed to fluctuate relative to each other. The widening, which was in response to massive selling pressures on the French franc and several other currencies, followed sharp increases in short-term interest rates in the affected countries. With exchange market participants continuing to focus on Japan's trade surplus, the dollar fell substantially against the yen.  M2 expanded only slightly in July after growing appreciably over the second quarter. The continued strength of inflows to bond and stock mutual funds suggested that households were still realigning their portfolios toward assets outside the monetary aggregates. Through July, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate close to the lower end of the Committee's range for the year. M3 contracted slightly in June and July, owing in part to a substantial drop in institution-only money market mutual funds, whose returns had not kept pace with the increase in money market rates in late spring. In addition, depository institutions placed greater reliance on various nondeposit sources of funds, including the issuance of equity and subordinated debt. Through July, M3 had declined a little and was slightly below its annual range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through June was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested moderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital through next year. The fiscal restraint stemming from the recent legislation and uncertainty about other government policies would act as a drag on the economy. On the other hand, lower interest rates were expected to contribute to further gains in spending on consumer durables, housing, and business fixed investment. Continued expansion also would be supported by further improvements in the availability of credit, a small boost to production over the next several quarters associated with rebuilding activity in areas of the Midwest affected by the recent floods, and a pickup in foreign demand resulting from some strengthening in economic activity abroad. The projected slack in labor and product markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to foster modest further reductions in wage and price inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of prospective economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had not materially altered the outlook for moderate and sustained growth in economic activity. Despite widespread indications of pessimistic consumer and business attitudes, overall consumer spending and business investment appeared to be reasonably well maintained. Likewise, the outlook for increased fiscal restraint associated with the recently enacted deficit-reduction legislation needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on spending of reduced interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets, the improved balance sheets of consumers and businesses, and the indications of a somewhat better availability of loans from financial intermediaries. In an environment of moderate economic growth, the fundamentals bearing on the outlook for inflation were consistent with further disinflation, and the members drew some encouragement from consumer and producer price developments in recent months. Several cautioned, however, that recent price measures probably overstated the reduction in inflation, just as the surge in prices earlier in the year seemed to have overstated the underlying inflation trend. Members also referred to the persistence of inflationary expectations among business executives and consumers. Thus, while the rise in inflation appeared to have been arrested, any further progress toward price stability was likely to be limited over the quarters ahead.  Business contacts and other sources of information suggested little change since the July meeting in the pace or composition of economic activity in different parts of the country. Descriptions of economic performance varied from slow to moderate growth in most regions, though business activity probably continued to weaken in some major areas such as California. Despite sustained, if not ebullient, growth in sales to consumers and the relative strength in business investment spending in the first half of this year, business sentiment was widely described as cautious or negative even in some regions whose economies were outperforming the nation as a whole. According to business contacts, the recent enactment of deficit-reduction legislation had tended to mitigate concerns about the size of future federal deficits, but business executives were now focusing on the implications of higher taxes and many were expressing apprehension about further though still unannounced tax increases that might be associated with health care reform. Business sentiment and sales also were being affected adversely in many areas by cutbacks in defense contracts and closings of military installations and by the weakness in foreign demand for some products.  With regard to developments and prospects in key sectors of the economy, members noted that despite further survey indications of eroding consumer confidence, consumer expenditures had strengthened in recent months after a pause earlier in the year. The pickup had featured rising sales of motor vehicles, and while the latter had slipped recently, a number of special factors such as shortages of popular models at the end of the model year and the effects of flooding in some parts of the Midwest suggested the need to withhold judgment on any downward shift in the underlying demand for motor vehicles. Tourism was reported to have strengthened considerably in many areas this summer, though there were major exceptions. As had been true for an extended period, consumer attitudes continued to be inhibited by concerns about employment opportunities, especially given further reductions in defense spending, the ongoing restructuring and related downsizing of many business operations, and the continuing efforts by business firms to limit the number of their permanent employees in order to hold down the rising costs of health care and other nonwage worker benefits. Members noted, however, that the growth in employment thus far this year, while tending to involve many low paying jobs, had greatly exceeded the rate of expansion in 1992. In the view of at least some members, appreciable further growth was likely as business firms found it increasingly difficult in an expanding economy to meet growing demands through outsourcing, temporary workers, and overtime work. Some members also noted that the newly legislated taxes on higher incomes would tend to curtail some consumer spending. The timing of that effect was uncertain; tax liabilities had already risen, but some payments on the added tax liabilities were not due until April of 1994 and 1995.  Members anticipated that building activity, notably housing construction, would provide some stimulus to the expansion. Although indicators of housing activity were somewhat mixed for the nation as a whole, sales of new and existing homes were brisk in many regions and even sales of second homes were reported to be improving in some areas. Prospective homebuyers continued to exercise considerable caution, but reductions in mortgage rates and generally improved affordability pointed to rising housing sales and construction over the quarters ahead. In the nonresidential sector, there was growing evidence of some strengthening in the construction of commercial and institutional structures, but overcapacity was likely to depress the construction of new office buildings for an extended period in most parts of the country. In some areas, infrastructure and other rebuilding associated with the recent floods was likely to stimulate some construction activity later this year.  With regard to the external sector of the economy, the members again noted a somewhat mixed picture. Exporters from some parts of the country continued to report relatively brisk sales abroad, but many domestic producers were expressing concerns about weak markets in key foreign nations. Against the background of more stimulative economic policies in a number of those countries, some overall strengthening in the major foreign economies was viewed as a reasonable expectation, but the overall growth in exports was likely to lag the anticipated expansion in imports over the projection horizon. The North American Free Trade Agreement now under consideration in the Congress was a topic of active discussion among business contacts, and the uncertain outcome of that treaty was a matter of concern in several parts of the country.  Members observed that the more favorable performance of key measures of prices in recent months had tended to relieve earlier concerns about a possible worsening of inflation. However, because the recent price indexes probably overstated the improvement in the trend rate of inflation, it was too early to determine whether they pointed to renewed disinflation. In any event, a number of fundamental factors appeared to have favorable implications for the inflation outlook, notably the prospect that some slack in labor and capital resources would persist in the context of projections that pointed to a relatively moderate rate of economic expansion. Members continued to cite reports from numerous business firms regarding their inability to raise prices because of the highly competitive markets in which those firms had to operate. Many business contacts also referred to the absence of significant increases--and indeed to occasional decreases--in the costs of their outside purchases. Oil price developments in world markets and the ongoing competition from foreign producers also were noted as favorable elements in the outlook for inflation. On the negative side, adverse weather conditions in recent months including severe floods in the Midwest appeared to have fostered some upward pressure on food prices, and higher taxes would raise gasoline prices in the fourth quarter. Perhaps of greater significance, business contacts and surveys of households indicated persisting expectations that inflation would rise at some point. In this connection, however, passage of the federal deficit-reduction legislation and the Committee's reaffirmation in its directive and in congressional testimony of its commitment to price stability seemed to have had a constructive effect on attitudes in financial markets and on long-term interest rates, and these developments could prove to be harbingers of more favorable inflation attitudes more generally.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members agreed that recent developments pointed to the desirability of a steady policy course. While economic growth did not seem particularly robust, neither was it clear that a disinflationary trend had been reestablished. Many members observed that real short-term interest rates were at very low levels, indeed slightly negative by some calculations, and while real intermediate- and long-term interest rates were higher, it was apparent that monetary policy was in an accommodative posture. This conclusion was seen as reinforcing the view that monetary policy probably would have to move in the direction of restraint at some point to resist any incipient tendency for inflationary pressures to intensify. For now, the relatively slow economic expansion in the first half of the year, the fiscal restraint associated with the deficit-reduction legislation, other obstacles to economic growth, and the encouraging inflation statistics for recent months argued against any near-term policy adjustment.  Moreover, there was no compelling evidence that current monetary policy was fostering credit flows usually associated with speculative excesses or impending increases in price pressures. Growth in the broad measures of money and in the debt of nonfinancial sectors remained fairly damped despite indications of greater willingness to supply credit by banks, other financial intermediaries, and investors in securities markets. With regard to the monetary aggregates, low short-term interest rates undoubtedly were contributing to large shifts of funds from depository institutions, notably from components of M2 and M3 to stock and bond mutual funds and to other financial instruments, and thus to the sluggish behavior of the broad measures of money. In this connection, a staff analysis pointed to continuing slow growth in M2 over the near term and, on the assumption of little or no change in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, to growth for the year at a rate around the lower end of the Committee's range. Growth in M3 was likely to fall marginally below the Committee's range for the year. On the other hand, growth in Ml and in various reserve measures was expected to remain relatively robust.  Turning to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period ahead, the members endorsed a proposal to return to an unbiased intermeeting instruction that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the direction of possible intermeeting policy changes. The members agreed that the probability of an intermeeting policy adjustment was relatively remote. Incoming data on economic activity and prices had reduced concerns that inflation and inflationary expectations might be worsening. The Committee retained its fundamental objectives of fostering economic expansion at a sustainable pace that was consistent with further progress over time toward stable prices. However, it now appeared less likely than at the time of the May and July meetings that the Committee needed to bias its consideration of responses to incoming information in the intermeeting period toward possible tightening in order to achieve those objectives. One member, while agreeing that a tightening move would not be appropriate under current circumstances, nonetheless believed that monetary policy had been overly stimulative for some time and that the Committee should move toward restraint at the first favorable opportunity.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members expressed a preference for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. They also indicated their support of a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and little net change in M3 over the balance of the third quarter.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in July at a rate close to its average advance in earlier months of the year, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.8 percent. Industrial production turned up in July after posting small declines in May and June. Retail sales edged higher in July following a sizable rise in the second quarter. Housing starts were down somewhat in July, but permits moved up. Available indicators point to continued expansion in business capital spending. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined in May, but for April and May combined it was larger than its average rate in the first quarter. After rising at a faster rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices have changed little and producer prices have fallen in recent months.  Short-and intermediate-term interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting on July 6-7, while yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period.  After expanding appreciably over the second quarter, M2 increased slightly further in July and M3 declined. For the year through July, M2 is estimated to have grown at a rate close to the lower end of the Committee's range for the year, and M3 at a rate slightly below its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through June it is estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases would persist over the balance of the year and that money growth within these lower ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and little net change in M3 over the balance of the third quarter.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed by the Committee at this meeting suggested that economic activity, adjusted for the temporary depressing effects of the flood in the Midwest, was continuing to expand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending was up, and business purchases of durable equipment had recorded further healthy gains. On the other hand, housing activity had shown a muted response to the declines in mortgage rates that had occurred through the spring, and gains in manufacturing output and in employment had been limited in recent months. After rising at an accelerated rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices had increased more slowly in recent months and producer prices had fallen.  Total nonfarm payroll employment edged lower in August after a sizable gain in July. Hiring in the service-producing sectors, especially in health and business services, was down in August from the pace of recent months, and more jobs were lost in manufacturing. Construction employment also moved lower, retracing part of the July increase. On the other hand, the average workweek rose to a relatively high level in August, and as a result, aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers were significantly above the second-quarter average. The civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent.  Industrial production posted a further moderate gain in August. Manufacturing output more than accounted for the increase, as strikes damped mining production and utilities output was unchanged following large gains in earlier months. Within manufacturing, the output of motor vehicles and parts was unchanged. Excluding the motor vehicle component, another sharp gain in computers and related electronic components boosted the production of business equipment, while the output of consumer goods declined as a result of a retrenchment in appliance production following the advance posted in July. Total utilization of manufacturing capacity edged up again in August.  Total retail sales were little changed in real terms in July and August. Despite the recent sluggishness, however, real spending for goods in July and August was appreciably above the level in the second quarter. In addition, real expenditures for services had grown rapidly in July; this reflected both high energy consumption associated with unusually hot weather and robust spending for other services. The persistence of hot weather through August suggested that spending on energy services continued at a high level for that month. After a slight decline in July, housing starts rose substantially in August. Single-family starts accounted for all of the August increase, as multifamily starts fell further and continued to hover around their thirty-year low.  Growth in real business fixed investment appeared to be slowing in the third quarter from the robust pace earlier in the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods dropped substantially in July, with all of the decline occurring in the volatile aircraft component. For capital goods other than aircraft and parts, shipments again moved higher in July; while the demand for computing equipment strengthened after dropping off somewhat in the second quarter, shipments of other types of durable equipment softened. In addition, heavy-truck sales were off substantially in July after advancing steadily since late 1992, and fleet sales of light vehicles were down in July and August. Investment in nonresidential structures posted its largest advance in three years in the second quarter. However, construction activity fell in July in reflection of a sharp decline in the construction of commercial structures other than offices.  Business inventories contracted sharply in July after changing little in June. The bulk of the July decline occurred in the retail sector and reflected drawdowns in inventories at automobile dealerships. Non-auto retail inventories edged down in July; with sales flat, the ratio of non-auto inventories to sales remained near the high end of the range for the past several years. In the wholesale trade sector, stocks were trimmed somewhat further in July, but the inventory-to-sales ratio remained at the midpoint of its range over the past three years. Manufacturing stocks were unchanged in July after a small reduction in June. With shipments down in July owing to weak shipments of aircraft and motor vehicles, the stocks-to-sales ratio rebounded in July but was still at a low level.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit decreased in July, but it remained essentially unchanged from its average rate in the second quarter. The value of exports edged lower in July, while the value of imports fell by more, retracing nearly all of the sizable June rise. The decline in imports was primarily in automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The performance of the major foreign industrial economies continued to present a mixed picture. Economic activity in Japan, after increasing slightly in the first quarter, evidenced renewed weakness in the second quarter that apparently persisted into the third quarter. In western Germany, real output rose in the second quarter, but much of the gain apparently stemmed from unintended inventory accumulation. In France and Italy, economic activity appeared to have leveled out in the second quarter after declining earlier. By contrast, both the United Kingdom and Canada recorded further modest gains in economic activity.  Producer prices of finished goods fell sharply further in August; higher prices for consumer foods were more than offset by lower prices for the energy and the nonfood, non-energy components of the index. For finished goods other than food and energy, producer prices increased over the twelve months ended in August by a considerably smaller amount than in the previous twelve-month period. Consumer prices rose a little faster in August than in July, with an increase in food prices counterbalancing a decline in prices of consumer energy goods. For nonfood, non-energy items, consumer prices advanced over the twelve months ended in August by an amount comparable to that recorded for the twelve months ended in August 1992. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were up in August after little change on balance in June and July; the rise reflected in part overtime earnings in manufacturing. Over the twelve months ended in August, this measure of earnings increased by about the same amount as in the previous twelve-month period.  At its meeting on August 17, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that, in contrast to the two previous directives, did not include a tilt toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and little net change in M3 over the balance of the third quarter.  Open market operations were directed during the intermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent over the period, while adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above anticipated levels, reflecting demand for adjustment credit by banks experiencing temporary technical difficulties.  Other short-term interest rates were little changed on balance over the intermeeting period, while yields on intermediate- and long-term debt obligations declined somewhat. The drop in longer-term yields appeared to be associated with incoming data indicating continuing sluggishness in economic activity and the more favorable performance of broad measures of prices. Major indexes of stock prices increased somewhat further over the intermeeting period, evidently reflecting lower bond yields and heavy inflows to stock mutual funds.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated on balance over the intermeeting period. Much of the dollar's decline reflected the strength of the mark and other European currencies, which was related in part to the unexpectedly slow pace of monetary easing in Germany and other European countries. Against the yen, the dollar rebounded early in the intermeeting period from the historical low that occurred around the time of the Committee's August meeting. The dollar was buoyed by joint central bank sales of yen against the dollar and by the accompanying public statement from the U.S. Treasury that was seen by market participants as signaling a new attitude toward any further appreciation of the yen. On September 21, the dollar rose sharply on news that President Yeltsin had dissolved the Russian Parliament.  Growth of M2 continued at a slow rate in August. The sluggishness in this aggregate, which occurred despite further rapid expansion in its Ml component, apparently reflected ongoing efforts by households to shift funds away from depository accounts in search of better returns. M3 turned up after declining in June and July; however, expansion of this aggregate continued to be held down by declines in institution-only money market funds. For the year through August, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates close to the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, and for the year through July it was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested moderate growth in economic activity and limited reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital through next year. Fiscal restraint, uncertainty about other government policies, and slow growth of foreign industrial economies over the near term would act as a constraint on the economy. However, improving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were lifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest rates would encourage further increases in consumer spending, housing construction, and business fixed investment. The continued slack in labor and product markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had not altered their outlook for moderate and sustained expansion in economic activity. The members acknowledged that the interpretation of ongoing developments presented some unusual problems, notably the difficulty of reconciling the appreciable growth in employment thus far this year with the slow expansion in measured output: the associated drop in measured productivity was especially surprising in light of the business drive toward more efficient operations. Moreover, the economic outlook clearly remained subject to a variety of uncertainties, including potential developments abroad that were especially difficult to predict. Nonetheless, while temporary factors were likely to depress third-quarter expansion, the members saw little in the current statistical or anecdotal reports on the domestic economy that pointed to the likelihood of a significant deviation from a moderate growth trend. It was noted in this connection that the inhibiting effects of increased fiscal restraint and expected further weakness in net exports needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on interest-sensitive spending of considerably reduced intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the much improved financial condition of many business firms and households. With regard to the outlook for inflation, some members suggested that the prospects for continued slack in resource utilization were consistent with a disinflationary trend, but the disparate factors bearing on the outlook for inflation as well as the swings in price performance experienced in recent quarters argued for caution in assessing the future course of inflation.  In their review of developments around the nation, members commented that business conditions remained uneven across local areas and industries, but they characterized general economic activity in most regions as ranging from little change to moderate growth since mid-summer. However, business conditions continued to be quite weak in some areas, notably in California, and business sentiment appeared to have remained cautious in much of the nation. One member emphasized uneven conditions of a different kind. Relatively disadvantaged members of the population, often living in inner cities, had high and rising expectations about their economic prospects. At the same time, however, some traditional paths of upward mobility were being cut back, such as the military and civil service within the government and office jobs more generally. In addition, regulations aimed at correcting some problems in financial institutions--such as real estate appraisal and downpayment requirements--were having unintended adverse effects on lower-income businesses and households, and other proposals aimed at promoting minority lending were in danger of promising more than they could deliver. An apparently widening gap between economic realities and aspirations might not have measurable implications for the macroeconomic outlook over short periods of time, but they reflected a worrisome trend in terms of the longer-run health of the economy.  In other comments, members referred to a number of financial developments that had favorable implications for sustained economic expansion. Business firms and consumers had made substantial progress in strengthening their balance sheets, and while the process of adjusting balance sheets evidently was still under way, the material improvement accomplished thus far had diminished financial risks and constraints on spending. Banking institutions had bolstered their capital positions and were in a better position to accommodate increases in loan demand. Bond and stock markets had exhibited considerable strength. In this connection, however, a few members commented on the apparently growing concern in financial markets that current equity prices were high relative to earnings and dividends. A correction in U.S. equity markets could trigger cumulative selling, especially by mutual funds, which had garnered substantial new investors, some of whom might not fully appreciate the risks of their new assets relative to deposits. On the positive side, there were good reasons for optimism on the trajectory of business profits in an environment of low inflation and moderate growth. Moreover, some managers of mutual funds reportedly were taking steps to strengthen the liquidity of their portfolios, and members reported on efforts to improve individual investor awareness of the risks of equity investments.  During their review of the prospective performance of key sectors of the economy, members gave somewhat mixed reports on retail sales in recent weeks, but they generally anticipated that consumer spending would provide continued if not strong support to sustained economic expansion. As had been true for an extended period, consumer attitudes remained hesitant in the context of concerns about employment and income prospects and, in the case of many consumers with higher incomes, increased income tax liabilities. Some members expressed the view that more vigorous growth in employment might well occur as the expansion matured, and such a development would be likely to have a favorable effect on consumer attitudes and spending.  Cautious attitudes also appeared to have held back housing demand and construction activity despite declines in mortgage interest rates. The combination of some further declines in mortgage interest rates recently and a tendency for house prices to stabilize or even to firm in some markets seemed to have induced appreciable and widespread strengthening in demand for single-family housing. Indeed, despite persisting weakness in some areas, housing markets were described as quite strong in many parts of the country, and the overall improvement in housing activity might not be captured in the latest statistics. Other construction activity appeared on the whole to have bottomed out and might have begun to trend higher. Anecdotal reports suggested a pickup in the volume of commercial property transactions, though apparently not yet in the prices of commercial properties in most areas, and rising construction outlays were anticipated for commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities as economic activity continued to expand. Office construction was likely to remain generally depressed as excess capacity continued to be absorbed, but such construction might not decline further. Members also anticipated appreciable further growth in business spending for equipment, notably for the purpose of enhancing productivity in an environment of strong competitive pressures; concurrently, spending to expand capacity seemed likely to remain relatively limited unless consumer spending gathered more momentum in coming quarters than was now anticipated. On balance, business fixed investment was expected to continue to provide considerable support to the economic expansion.  The passage of deficit-reduction legislation in July implied increased fiscal restraint but also appeared to have improved confidence in financial markets and in the business community more generally regarding the ability of the federal government to enact needed legislation. At the same time, the new taxes stemming from that legislation and a greater focus on the potential for further legislation, notably health care reform and its implications for mandated business costs, were a key factor in sustaining cautious attitudes among business executives. Members also referred to the constraining effects in many areas, and on the economy more generally, of current and prospective cutbacks in defense expenditures, spending curbs by state and local governments, and the outlook for further tax increases by many of these governments.  The prospects for net exports also were cited as a negative factor in the economic outlook. Expectations of persisting weakness in some major foreign economies implied relatively limited growth in U.S. exports in a period when moderate expansion in this country was likely to foster somewhat more rapid increases in U.S. imports. Some members also commented that the controversial NAFTA legislation under consideration in the Congress continued to dominate business discussions in parts of the country. It was suggested that whatever its eventual benefits for the three nations immediately involved might be, a defeat of that legislation could prove to be a setback for the GATT negotiations with dislocative implications for world trade.  Many members referred to the more favorable price developments that had occurred since the early part of the year when key measures of inflation had surged. While it was premature to conclude that a distinct disinflationary trend had been re-established, the members generally agreed that price pressures were likely to remain subdued given their projections of some continuing slack in resource utilization. Favorable developments tending to support that conclusion included the persistence of intensely competitive conditions in most markets for goods around the country. The costs of materials purchased by business firms generally were reported to be rising only slowly, if at all. There were indications of fairly tight labor markets in some areas, but wage pressures remained limited even in those markets. At the same time, the costs of worker benefits continued to rise fairly rapidly and many business contacts were expressing concern about the possibility of further mandated cost increases related to the health care reform legislation. For the next several months, relatively rapid increases in food prices associated with weather-related crop losses and an increase in the excise tax on gasoline would tend to boost consumer prices. On balance, these developments were not seen as inconsistent with longer-run progress toward price stability, though the inflation outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all of the members agreed that recent economic and financial developments pointed to the desirability of an unchanged policy stance. The members recognized that neither the pace of the economic expansion nor the uncertain progress toward price stability reflected a wholly satisfactory economic performance, but at this point the present posture of monetary policy continued to offer the best promise in their view of promoting sustained economic growth in the context of subdued if not declining inflation.  From the perspective of a variety of financial measures, the current monetary policy continued quite accommodative. Short-term interest rates were low, indeed close to zero after adjustment for inflation, and there had been appreciable further declines in longer-term interest rates. Growth of M2 remained slow, but it had picked up since earlier in the year, and M3 had expanded in August, albeit at a sluggish rate, after declining in previous months. One member observed that growth in M2, adjusted to include certain stock and bond mutual funds, was estimated to have accelerated since early spring to a fairly healthy pace. Narrow measures of money and reserves, though subject to a variety of influences, were growing at rates that suggested an ample provision of liquidity to the economy.  In considering possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all of the members endorsed a proposal to retain a symmetrical directive. While current economic uncertainties were mirrored in uncertainties about the future course of monetary policy, the members agreed that developments in the period until the next meeting in mid-November were not likely to call for any adjustment to policy. Beyond the nearer term, however, both the timing and, in the view of at least some members, the direction of the next policy change could not be foreseen at this time. While they did not see convincing evidence that monetary policy was overly stimulative at this point, some members were concerned the current stance, as reflected in short-term interest rates, was quite accommodative and probably would need to be firmed at some point. These members stressed the need to remain especially alert to potential inflationary developments against the background of persisting inflationary expectations and uncertain progress toward price stability. Other members, while sharing this concern to an extent, gave some weight to the possibility that the expansion might remain quite sluggish for a period; under the circumstances, they foresaw the need to maintain an accommodative policy posture and could not rule out the possibility that the next policy move might have to be toward greater monetary stimulus.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated their support of a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment edged down in August after a sizable gain in July, but the average workweek rose to a relatively high level and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent. Industrial production has advanced moderately over recent months. Retail sales changed little in real terms in July and August after increasing appreciably in the second quarter. Housing starts were down slightly in July but rose substantially in August. Available indicators suggest a slowing in the expansion of business capital spending from a robust pace earlier in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was about unchanged in July from its average rate in the second quarter. After rising at an accelerated rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices have increased more slowly and producer prices have fallen in recent months.  Short-term interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting on August 17, while yields on intermediate and long-term debt obligations have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated substantially over the intermeeting period.  M2 continued to expand at a slow rate in August, while M3 turned up after declining in June and July. For the year through August, M2 and M3 are estimated to have grown at rates close to the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through July it is estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases would persist over the balance of the year and that money growth within these lower ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in recent months. Consumer spending had picked up: housing activity was quickening; and business spending for durable equipment had continued to trend higher, though at a reduced pace. Industrial production, particularly manufacturing, and employment had posted solid gains. At the same time, inflation had remained muted, with consumer prices increasing moderately on balance in recent months and producer prices falling.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably in September and October after declining slightly in August. Although job gains were widespread in October, a large part of the increase was in various business services, notably temporary employment agencies. In other categories, construction employment registered its largest monthly rise since last spring, and jobs in manufacturing increased after seven months of declines. The civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.8 percent in October.  Industrial production rose sharply in October, with manufacturing more than accounting for the increase. Part of the gain in manufacturing reflected a further rebound in the output of motor vehicles and parts. Aside from motor vehicles, however, the production of business equipment was lifted by another surge in office and computing equipment, and the output of consumer goods was boosted by strength in furniture and appliances. Utilization of total industrial capacity rose in October, reaching a level last seen in the fourth quarter of 1992.  Nominal retail sales were up substantially in October after changing little in September. Sales in October were boosted by a turnaround in spending at automobile dealerships and by a surge at building materials and supply stores. Sales at other types of retail outlets were mixed. Purchases at general merchandise stores were brisk. However, sales at apparel outlets and at furniture and appliance stores edged down after rising strongly for several months, and the increase in spending at gasoline stations entirely reflected the effects of the new federal gasoline tax on pump prices. Housing activity strengthened further in the third quarter. Starts of single-family homes in August and September were at their highest levels in almost five years; starts of multifamily units also picked up in September, although construction activity in this sector remained at a very low level. Sales of new and existing homes moved up further in the third quarter and were especially strong in September.  Real business capital spending increased in the third quarter at a considerably slower pace than earlier in the year. The slowdown largely reflected a smaller rise in spending for producers' durable equipment, as reduced outlays for aircraft and motor vehicles more than offset continued strong gains in spending for computing equipment and other capital goods. Nonresidential construction was down slightly in the third quarter after a sizable advance over the first half of the year. Office and industrial building activity appeared to have bottomed out, but high vacancy rates and declining property values continued to limit new construction.  Business inventories climbed significantly further in September; for the third quarter as a whole, however, stocks were accumulated at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the year. At the retail level, inventories rebounded in September after declining on balance over July and August. The ratio of inventories to sales for retailing edged up in September but remained near the low end of its range over the past year. Inventory accumulation in the wholesale sector slowed in September after rising substantially in August: the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was unchanged at the midpoint of its range over the past several years. In manufacturing, stocks dropped in September after changing little over the two previous months; with factory shipments up, the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as whole fell in September to its lowest level in recent years.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined further in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was about the same as its average rate for the second quarter. The value of both exports and imports was slightly lower in July-August than in the second quarter. The decline in the value of exports primarily reflected shortfalls in shipments of aircraft and automotive products, and the drop in imports was associated with reduced imports of oil and automotive products. Available data indicated that the performance of the major foreign industrial economies continued to be mixed. Economic activity appeared to have remained weak in Japan in the third quarter and to have stagnated in western Germany after increasing moderately in the second quarter. On the other hand, the recessions in France and Italy seemed to have bottomed out, and the economies of Canada and the United Kingdom to have recovered somewhat further.  Producer prices for finished goods fell in October, retracing the small increase in September; excluding the effects of higher prices for finished foods and energy goods, producer prices were down over the September-October period. Over the twelve-month period ended in October, producer prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were fractionally higher on balance, the lowest yearly increase on record for this index, which was introduced in 1973. Consumer prices rose in October after being unchanged in September, with the increase partly reflecting the effect of the implementation of the new federal gasoline tax. For nonfood, non-energy consumer items, the rise in consumer prices over the twelve months ended in October was considerably smaller than the rise over the comparable period ended in October 1992. Labor compensation costs did not show a comparable downtrend. The increase in hourly compensation for private industry workers in the third quarter was about the same as in the second quarter. For the twelve months ended in September, hourly compensation advanced slightly faster than over the comparable year-earlier period.  At its meeting on September 21, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the year.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above anticipated levels as a result of increased demands for adjustment credit associated with quarter-end pressures in financial markets and an unexpected swing in the Treasury balance. The federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent over the period.  Most other interest rates were up somewhat over the period since the Committee's September meeting. Treasury bill rates rose in part because of the Treasury's need to rely more heavily on bill issuance in a quarter containing a reduced schedule for auctioning long-term debt. Intermediate- and long-term yields fell in the weeks following the September meeting and reached twenty-year lows. These declines were more than reversed subsequently, however, when investors interpreted incoming data as suggesting stronger economic growth and credit demands over the intermediate term and a somewhat greater likelihood of some tightening of monetary policy. Most indexes of stock market prices posted robust gains early in the intermeeting period, but these gains subsequently were pared back as interest rates moved higher.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated over the intermeeting period. The strengthening of the dollar, and the associated rise in U.S. long-term interest rates relative to foreign rates, reflected both more optimistic expectations for growth in the United States and more pessimistic assessments for the course of economic activity in continental Europe and Japan.  M2 registered a relatively strong advance in September, but growth slowed again in October. The September pickup partly reflected an unexpected surge in the volatile overnight repurchase agreement (RP) component of M2. Ml also was strong, but the total of time and savings deposits continued to decline, apparently in large part because of the persisting allure of capital market instruments. Growth of M3 strengthened somewhat more than M2 over the two months, reflecting a run-up in institution-only money market funds. For the year through October, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates a little above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through September it was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity, after advancing relatively strongly in the fourth quarter, would expand moderately next year, about in line with the potential rate of economic growth over time, and thus would be associated with limited, if any, further reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital. Consumer spending, which had buoyed growth recently, was expected to expand at the same pace as incomes over the year ahead. In addition, fiscal restraint and uncertainty about other government policies would continue to inhibit the expansion, and a sluggish acceleration in foreign industrial economies pointed to only modest improvement in export demand. However, improving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were lifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest rates would encourage further increases in business fixed investment and housing construction. The continued slack in labor and product markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of the economic outlook, members commented that the economic data and anecdotal reports received since the September meeting had tended to reinforce their earlier forecasts that moderate economic expansion would be sustained. After a sluggish performance in the first half of the year, overall economic activity had picked up somewhat more in the third quarter than most members had anticipated and available indicators of spending and production pointed to relatively robust economic growth in the current quarter. Looking ahead to 1994, the members expected the expansion to slow somewhat from its apparent pace over the closing months of this year. Fluctuations in the rate of quarterly GDP growth undoubtedly would occur, but the economy over the year ahead was thought likely to continue on a trend of moderate expansion averaging close to the economy's long-run potential or somewhat higher. Most members saw the probability of a sharp deviation in either direction from their current forecasts as relatively remote, though a number also believed that any deviation was more likely to be in the direction of somewhat stronger rather than weaker growth. In general, members expected core inflation to change little or to edge lower next year, but a few saw some danger of marginally higher inflation.  In their assessment of developments underlying the economic outlook, members referred to indications in many areas of some strengthening in business conditions and in related business sentiment, though economic activity clearly remained sluggish or even depressed in some parts of the country and overall business attitudes could still be described as cautious. Current financial conditions, including the strength in equity markets, reduced intermediate- and long-term interest rates, and an apparently improving availability of business credit from financial institutions, provided a favorable backdrop for further economic expansion. Moreover, businesses and households had made substantial progress in improving their financial positions. These factors were seen as reducing downside risks to the expansion. At the same time, while there were signs of significant firming in the economic expansion, a number of members observed that at this point they did not see the usual indications of any near-term intensification of inflationary pressures such as general increases in commodity prices, lengthening delivery lead times along with efforts to increase inventories, and strong growth of credit. Indeed, the risks of an overheated and inflationary expansion in the near term seemed quite limited in light of various constraints on the economy such as those associated with a restrictive fiscal policy and the continuing weakness in key export markets.  With regard to the outlook for specific sectors of the economy, a step-up in consumer spending, notably for motor vehicles and housing-related durable goods, had contributed substantially to the strengthening of the economic expansion. Indications of improving consumer confidence, reflected in turn in the growing optimism expressed by business contacts regarding the outlook for holiday sales, should help to sustain relatively ebullient consumer spending through the year-end. Contacts in the motor vehicles industry also appeared to be relatively optimistic about the prospects for sales of the new models. The outlook for the consumer sector also was subject to some constraining influences. Growth in consumer spending had tended to exceed the expansion in consumer incomes and a number of members questioned the extent to which the acceleration in such spending was likely to extend into the new year. The saving rate already was near the low end of its historic range, at least on the basis of current estimates, and was unlikely to decline significantly, if at all. Much would depend on consumers' outlook for employment and incomes. Growing demands should eventually be translated into faster employment gains, but at this point business firms continued to resist adding to their workforces despite increasing sales and many firms were still announcing workforce reductions. While net gains in employment, including growth associated with increases in self-employment and new business formations, were continuing, expansion in jobs and consumer incomes probably would be at a moderate pace over the year ahead. Against this background, members generally expected moderate growth in consumer spending to be maintained, but they did not see such spending as likely to give extra impetus to growth in economic activity in 1994.  The members anticipated appreciable further expansion in business investment spending, especially in the context of reduced interest rates, improved business balance sheets, and ongoing efforts to improve productivity. Growth in spending for business equipment probably would continue at a relatively vigorous pace, though perhaps somewhat below the growth rates experienced in recent quarters, and other investment activity seemed poised to pick up. In this connection, several members reported that vacancy rates in commercial office buildings were declining in some areas and while this development was not yet being translated into appreciable new construction, investment funds appeared to be flowing more freely into commercial real estate. Clear indications of strengthening were observed in housing construction in many parts of the country and the outlook for such building activity seemed promising in the context of reduced mortgage rates and improving consumer sentiment.  Fiscal policy developments, including the effects on business attitudes of the uncertainties surrounding health care reform legislation, were likely to continue to inhibit the expansion over the year ahead. Some members again emphasized the negative effects that the ongoing retrenchment in defense spending was having on local economies as well as on the economy more generally. On the taxation side, the rise in tax liabilities on higher incomes could have an especially pronounced effect during the early months of next year, given the retroactive inclusion of 1993 incomes subject to the new tax, but some members noted that the increased tax payments probably had been widely anticipated and the negative implications for the economy might well be less than many observers expected. Nonetheless, the overall posture of fiscal policy and associated business concerns about the cost implications of possible future legislation were likely to be an important factor tending to limit the strength of the expansion.  Net exports were seen as another constraining factor in the performance of the economy next year. On the import side, even moderate expansion in domestic economic activity was likely to stimulate appreciable further growth in U. S. demands for foreign goods. At the same time, the prospects for exports to a number of major industrial countries were not promising, at least for the nearer term, given lagging economies in Europe and Japan. In this connection a number of members referred to reports of weak export demand for specific U.S. products and also noted that an extended coal mining strike had cut supplies of coal available for export and had induced some domestic firms to turn to imports to help fill their requirements. On the other hand, some markets for U.S. exports, notably those in a number of East Asian nations and some Latin American countries, were likely to continue to experience considerable growth, thereby mitigating an otherwise fairly gloomy outlook for exports.  With regard to the outlook for inflation over the year ahead, views did not vary greatly among the members. They ranged from expectations of some limited progress toward price stability to forecasts of a marginal increase in the core rate of inflation. Members who anticipated a relatively favorable inflation performance tended to underscore the likely persistence of appreciable slack in labor and other production resources on the assumption that growth in overall economic activity would remain on a moderate trend in line with their forecasts. Some also pointed to the absence of inflationary pressures in most commodity markets, the persistence of intense competition in local markets across the nation, and the outlook for relatively subdued increases in labor costs in part because of ongoing improvements in productivity. Other members gave more emphasis to the possibility that the economic expansion next year, especially if it turned out on the high side of the range encompassing the members' current projections, was more likely to be associated with some upward pressures on costs and prices. In this connection, relatively rapid growth in economic activity, should it persist into the early part of next year, probably would trigger attempts to raise prices and wages somewhat more rapidly even in the context of some continuing slack in overall capacity and labor utilization. At this point, however, there were no significant indications of accelerating inflation and business contacts around the nation did not currently see or seem to anticipate increasing inflationary pressures.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members generally agreed that despite various indications of a pickup in economic growth, the underlying economic situation and the outlook for inflation had not changed sufficiently to warrant an adjustment in monetary policy. Looking beyond the intermeeting period, however, several members commented that the Committee might well have to consider the need to move from the currently stimulative stance of monetary policy toward a more neutral policy posture, should concerns about rising inflationary pressures begin to be realized. The members recognized the desirability of taking early action to arrest incipient inflationary pressures before they gathered strength, especially given the Committee's commitment not just to resist greater inflation but to foster sustained progress toward price stability. In appropriate circumstances, a prompt policy move also might allay market concerns about inflation with favorable implications for longer-term interest rates and the performance of interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The members acknowledged that current measures of inflation and anecdotal reports from around the nation did not on the whole suggest an intensification of inflation at this point. Moreover, the Committee had to be wary of misleading signals that were inherent in the saw-tooth pattern of typical economic expansions, and it needed to avoid a policy move that would incur an unnecessary risk to the expansion, given uncertainties about the degree to which recent strength in spending would persist. Most of the members concluded that on balance current economic conditions warranted a steady policy course and, in light of prevailing uncertainties, that it would be premature to anticipate any particular policy change or its timing. As a consequence, the members also concluded that the currently unbiased instruction in the directive relating to the direction of possible intermeeting policy changes should be retained; in any case, significant-changes in the outlook requiring policy action were viewed as unlikely in the relatively short period until the next scheduled meeting on December 21. One member expressed the differing view that a less accommodative policy would be more consistent over time with the Committee's desire to foster sustained economic expansion and progress toward price stability. However, this member also felt that a policy tightening move at this time might be seen as a response to a stronger economy, rather than an action that clearly was intended to underscore the Committee's commitment to price stability and therefore would elicit a favorable response in intermediate and long-term debt markets.  With regard to financial developments bearing on the economic outlook and the potential need to adjust monetary policy, members observed that the broader money and credit aggregates had strengthened somewhat since earlier in the year, though to still relatively moderate growth rates. Moreover, much of the acceleration in M2 and M3 could be attributed to special or temporary factors, and according to a staff analysis growth in these aggregates was likely to revert to relatively slow rates in coming months, assuming unchanged reserve conditions. At the same time, growth in M1 and reserves had remained comparatively rapid and in one view such growth might well be indicative of an overly stimulative monetary policy that would promote more inflation over time or at least prove inconsistent with further disinflation.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated their support of a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably in September and October, while the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.8 percent in October. Industrial production increased sharply in October, partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales were up substantially in October after changing little in September. Housing activity picked up further in the third quarter. The expansion of business capital spending has slowed from a robust pace earlier in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July-August was about unchanged from its average rate in the second quarter. Consumer prices have increased moderately on balance in recent months and producer prices have fallen.  Most interest rates have increased somewhat since the Committee meeting on September 21. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 picked up slightly on balance in September and October, while M3 strengthened to a somewhat greater extent over the two months. For the year through October, M2 and M3 are estimated to have grown at rates a little above the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through August it is estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases would persist over the balance of the year and that money growth within these lower ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, McTeer. Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.  Votes against this action: None.  The Committee approved a temporary increase of $3 billion, to a level of $11 billion, in the limit on changes between Committee meetings in System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. The increase amended paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and was effective for the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on December 21, 1993.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had recorded a strong advance in recent months. Consumer spending had picked up, and business purchases of durable equipment had remained on a marked upward trend. Residential construction was rising rapidly, and nonresidential construction had turned up from depressed levels. Industrial production had been boosted by developments in the motor vehicle industry, and employment had continued to post solid gains. Most indexes of prices pointed to little change in inflation trends despite the recent acceleration of economic activity.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in November. Another substantial increase in jobs was recorded in the services industries, notably in health and business services. Construction employment was up significantly further after registering modest gains on balance over the first three quarters of 1993. In manufacturing, there were back-to-back increases in jobs in October and November following seven consecutive monthly declines, and both overtime hours and the average workweek remained at a high level. Most of the November expansion in factory jobs occurred in the motor vehicle and capital goods industries. The civilian unemployment rate fell considerably in November, to 6.4 percent.  Industrial production increased sharply in October and November. Manufacturing accounted for all the gain over the two months, with the rise partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Elsewhere in manufacturing, strong advances were recorded in the output of computers and non-auto durable consumer goods. The sharp expansion in production was associated with substantial increases in the rate of utilization of industrial capacity in October and November.  Retail sales were up moderately in November after a large advance in October. Motor vehicle sales surged in October and remained at the higher level in November, apparently reflecting in part favorable financing terms, small price increases--adjusted for quality improvements--on 1994 models, and generous incentives on pickup trucks from some manufacturers. Sales of apparel, furniture and appliances, and other durable goods also were strong on balance over October and November. Housing starts rose substantially in November; starts of single-family units reached their highest level since early 1987, but starts of multifamily units edged lower. Sales of both new and existing homes remained robust in October.  Business spending for durable equipment apparently continued to rise rapidly. Among nondefense capital goods other than aircraft, shipments of computers and other durable equipment were significantly higher in October than in the third quarter. In addition, the demand for heavy trucks remained strong, and the brisk sales of light vehicles in October and November likely were the result in part of a step-up in spending by businesses. Nonresidential construction activity increased again in October: Office building declined further and industrial construction retraced part of a sizable September gain, but outlays for institutional, public utilities, and non-office commercial structures continued to move higher.  Business inventories were little changed in October, with reductions in manufacturing and wholesale stocks nearly offsetting increases at the retail level. A moderate further decline in manufacturers' inventories in October was concentrated among producers of aircraft and parts, where stocks have been contracting for more than two years; the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as a whole fell to its lowest level in recent years. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined in October after changing little in September, and the ratio of inventories to sales remained in the middle of its range over the past several years. At the retail level, stocks increased considerably further; with sales expanding vigorously, however, the ratio of stocks to sales edged lower and this ratio also was in the middle of its range over the past several years.  The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for October was about unchanged from its September level and its average rate for the third quarter. The value of both exports and imports increased in October. Exports of automotive products rose strongly, and exports of aircraft rebounded from a September downturn. The advance in imports was spread across all major categories. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third quarter; however, available data suggested that output in Japan and Germany might decline in the current quarter, with a depressing effect on growth for these industrial countries as a group.  Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices pointed to little change in inflation trends, although prices of some commodities and industrial materials had firmed recently. Producer prices of finished goods were unchanged in November after declining in October and over the third quarter. In November, a large drop in the prices of finished energy goods offset a rebound in the prices of other finished goods. Producer prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were about unchanged over the twelve months ended in November. At the consumer level, prices of items other than food and energy advanced moderately in November; the twelve-month increase in this price measure was a little smaller than the rise over the comparable period ended in November 1992. Average hourly earnings edged up in November; for the twelve months ended in November, these earnings were up by a smaller amount than over the preceding year.  At its meeting on November 16, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat less than anticipated levels, reflecting very light amounts of adjustment borrowing over most of the period, and the federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent.  While most short-term interest rates changed little over the intermeeting period, signs of stronger economic growth and the firming of some commodity prices tended to push up longer-term interest rates, although that pressure was offset to some extent by declines in oil prices. Taken as a whole, incoming economic data were seen by market participants as increasing the odds of a tightening of monetary policy at some point but not necessarily in the very near term. Most indexes of stock prices fell slightly over the intermeeting period, but the strong performance of a few firms boosted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new high near the end of the period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated against the yen in response to incoming data suggesting weakness in the Japanese economy and heightened prospects for further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. Even though interest rates eased in Europe as central banks lowered their money-market intervention rates, the dollar was little changed against the German mark and declined somewhat against other European currencies.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened appreciably in November; both aggregates had risen at somewhat faster rates since late summer than earlier in the year. Ml growth remained brisk in November, and money funds included in M2 apparently benefited from a slowdown in inflows to bond funds in the wake of the earlier decline in bond prices. The pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in term Eurodollar deposits as well as faster growth of M2. For the year through November, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates somewhat above the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, and for the year through November it was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a strong fourth-quarter advance, the economy would expand at a more moderate rate in 1994. Consumer spending was projected to decelerate to a rate more in line with the growth of disposable income. Business fixed investment was expected to advance briskly, although not quite as rapidly as in 1993, and further gains in homebuilding activity likely would be concentrated in the first half of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen somewhat, bolstered by a modest pickup in foreign economic growth. Fiscal restraint was expected to exert a substantial drag on spending, through both falling government defense purchases and higher taxes. In light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets, the ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight further reduction in inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications, both statistical and anecdotal, of a marked strengthening in economic activity and much improved business and consumer confidence in recent months. The rate of economic growth could be expected to moderate during the early months of 1994 from what currently appeared to be an unsustainable pace, but the members viewed the extent of such moderation as a key uncertainty in the outlook. A number of members observed that a sharp slowing of the expansion early next year, similar to the slowdown after the surge in activity during the closing months of 1992, could not be ruled out. However, most saw the gains in the economy as more solidly based than earlier in the expansion, and they generally expected the economy to settle into a pattern of moderate growth over coming quarters at a trend rate close to or somewhat above the economy's long-run potential. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the members saw little evidence in available measures of prices and wages or in other indicators that any significant change might already have occurred in underlying inflation trends. Nonetheless, views varied somewhat with regard to the outlook and ranged from expectations of some modest further decline in the core rate of inflation to concerns about the possibility of some acceleration in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed production resources and an accommodative monetary policy as reflected in low real short-term interest rates and continued rapid growth in narrow measures of money and reserves.  In their comments about developments across the nation, members observed that economic conditions clearly had strengthened in many regions and that the better conditions had fostered appreciable improvement in business and consumer sentiment in most parts of the country. The members recognized that the economic expansion was still quite subdued in many local areas and that economic activity remained depressed in some parts of the country such as southern California. The overall strength of the economy was fueled to an important extent by interest-sensitive spending on producer and consumer durables and housing and tended to confirm the durability of the expansion. Gains in such spending were not likely to be sustained at their recent rates, but the cash flow and income that such expenditures had generated were likely to foster further economic growth, especially in the context of generally supportive conditions in financial and credit markets. The members acknowledged that a number of factors continued to constrain the expansion, including ongoing though less pervasive balance-sheet rebuilding, business restructuring and downsizing activities, and the downtrend in defense spending. On balance, however, current developments did not point to a marked deviation from the moderate growth trend in economic activity that had been experienced over the past two years, though in the view of a number of members the odds on somewhat stronger growth were greater than they had been earlier in the expansion.  With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, consumer expenditures were seen as likely to continue to provide vital support to the expansion even though increases in consumer spending were not likely to be maintained at recent rates. Members noted that the improved consumer confidence and increased spending were reflected in a somewhat greater willingness to incur debt, at least in the context of reduced interest rates. Some members cautioned, however, that growth in consumer expenditures had exceeded gains in incomes for an extended period, insofar as could be judged from available data, and an already low saving rate seemed likely to limit the potential growth in such spending. Moreover, the negative impact of increased tax rates on high incomes seemed likely to be felt especially during the first half of 1994, though the extent of that impact on consumer spending remained uncertain. On the positive side, members cited a number of developments that would tend to bolster overall consumer expenditures, including lower energy costs, reduced income taxes for many individuals stemming from indexing, and lower interest charges on various kinds of debt. More generally, the rise in consumer confidence seemed to be related to perceptions of improving employment opportunities despite continuing announcements of sizable workforce reductions by some large firms.  The members expected growth in real business investment to remain robust in 1994 but to decelerate somewhat from the rapid rate of expansion over the past year. Continuing increases in business sales and low financing costs along with ongoing efforts to improve productivity were likely to remain conducive to substantial further growth in overall spending for business equipment despite persisting weakness in aerospace and defense-related industries. Nonresidential construction activity, including commercial and industrial building and infrastructure construction, displayed signs of considerable strength in some parts of the country; and declining vacancy rates pointed to a leveling out or even a pickup in nonresidential building construction in a number of other areas. Some expansion in inventories seemed likely over the forecast horizon to accommodate the continuing growth in overall demands. In this connection, members noted that a rise in inventories probably contributed to the expansion in production in recent months since the latter could not be explained entirely by the strength of final demand, and a buildup of motor vehicle stocks in late 1993 was likely to continue into the early part of 1994.  The housing sector was expected to remain a source of considerable economic stimulus during the early months of 1994, both directly and indirectly in terms of the favorable effects on purchases of home furnishings. Some members commented that the increases in housing starts experienced over the closing months of this year might not be sustainable; even so, housing construction, especially in the single-family sector, should be relatively well maintained given the likelihood that home ownership would remain comparatively affordable in the context of growing incomes, favorable mortgage rates, and limited pressures on the prices of new homes.  With respect to fiscal policy, members referred to the prospects for further cutbacks in defense spending that probably would continue to be offset only in part by growth in federal government purchases of other goods and services. However, net reductions in government purchases were expected to diminish over the projection horizon. Likewise, adverse effects on spending of the rise in tax rates on higher incomes would tend to be concentrated in the first half of 1994, and the impact on spending over the months ahead might well be relatively limited because many taxpayers probably had anticipated the higher taxes and had taken measures to mitigate or spread out their effects or would meet new tax obligations partly out of savings. Proposed health care reform legislation would exert a restraining effect on the economy, should it be enacted, owing to mandated cost increases on employers. If this form of financing were adopted, however, the legislation might have little, or perhaps even a favorable, effect on the federal deficit.  The external sector of the economy also appeared likely to have a moderating effect on domestic economic activity over the year ahead. The economies of key foreign industrial nations and thus U.S. exports to those nations were projected to grow only gradually, while the expansion of U.S. imports was likely to remain relatively robust on the basis of current expectations for domestic economic activity. In the view of at least some members, however, stimulative economic policies in a number of foreign countries might well lead to stronger economic performances and to greater demand for U.S. goods and services than many observers currently anticipated. In any event, the members generally agreed that the outlook for developments abroad remained a source of particular uncertainty for the domestic economy.  Members commented that there were few indications of any change in inflationary trends in broad measures of prices and wages despite the surge in economic activity in recent months and associated increases in capacity utilization rates. One important sign of growing inflationary pressures, rising lead times for deliveries of materials, had not emerged. Some members noted that while capacity usage rates were approaching or had reached levels that in the past had tended to signal the onset of rising inflation, the growth of competition stemming from the internationalization of numerous markets suggested that old capacity benchmarks might no longer apply and, especially in the context of excess capacity in many foreign economies, the potential inflationary effects of strong domestic demand pressures might remain subdued for some period of time. In keeping with these assessments, members again reported on the absence of inflationary cost pressures in local areas across the country and on persisting comments by business contacts regarding their inability to raise prices to achieve more satisfactory or customary profit margins. Business executives continued to look to improvements in productivity to maintain or increase their margins, and there were numerous reports of considerable success in implementing productivity gains. Price developments in commodity markets presented a mixed picture; higher food prices stemming from weather conditions earlier in the year had had an adverse effect on broad measures of prices, but the drop in energy prices had favorable implications for the near-term inflation outlook.  It also was noted that rising inflationary pressures often were accompanied by a pickup in credit demands, and there was no evidence of any surge in such demands. However, the expansion of overall nonfinancial debt had strengthened to a degree. Moreover, in the view of some members, the rise in long-term interest rates and in gold prices might well have been caused in part by heightened inflation concerns. Members also cited scattered examples of greater price pressures, notably the prices of lumber and some other building materials and of related efforts to pass on the added costs through higher prices on new homes in some areas. Despite the absence of any general indication of rising inflation, a number of members expressed concern about the potential for increasing inflationary pressures in the economy and saw a need to monitor possible future sources of inflation with special care over the period ahead, especially in light of the considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their effects on prices.  In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the period until the next scheduled meeting in early February, a majority of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in reserve markets and to retain the currently unbiased instruction in the directive concerning possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. Looking forward, many of the members commented that the Committee probably would have to firm reserve conditions at some point to adjust monetary policy from its currently quite accommodative stance to a more neutral position, and that such a policy move might have to be made sooner rather than later to contain inflation and continue to provide a sound basis for sustained economic expansion. Monetary conditions had been eased to their current degree of accommodation in the 1990-1992 period in the context of balance-sheet restructuring and other unusual forces that were holding down spending. Since the latter part of 1992, however, downside risks to the expansion had diminished considerably as financial conditions became more supportive of economic activity. Borrowers and lenders had strengthened their financial positions substantially and were less reluctant to use and extend credit. Moreover, the low level of real short-term interest rates and in the view of some members the continued rapid growth of reserves or increases in a variety of commodity prices provided evidence of a quite accommodative monetary policy. Overstaying such a policy would incur an increasing risk of fostering greater inflationary pressures that in turn would undermine the sustainability of the expansion. For now, however, a majority believed that the risks remained at an acceptable level, given the remaining slack in the economy and the lack of near-term inflation pressures. Waiting for further developments before making any policy move was warranted in light of the uncertainties surrounding the outlook, notably with regard to the extent of the moderation in economic growth expected early next year. If the economy settled into a pattern of growth about in line with its potential, the chances of greater inflation pressures down the road would be reduced and the need for a near-term policy adjustment would be less pressing, though it would still be required at some point.  Two members expressed a strong preference for a prompt move toward a firmer policy stance to forestall inflation pressures. A number of others commented that the decision was a close call, including two who had a marginal preference for tightening policy at this time but who could accept a delay in light of the uncertainties that were involved.  Members who could support an unchanged policy stance also indicated their acceptance of a directive that was not biased in either direction with regard to possible adjustments in the degree of reserve pressure during the intermeeting period. Some observed that while the flow of economic reports during this period was likely to underscore the marked strengthening of the economy, those reports mainly would cover developments in the fourth quarter, and from a monetary policy perspective the members were more interested in knowing something about the extent of the follow-through strength early in the new year. Moreover, the members recognized that any tightening move would represent a turn in policy that might well have a greater-than-usual effect on financial markets. This prospect argued for taking such an action at a meeting, with the benefit of a full Committee review of the implications for future growth and inflation pressures of a wide variety of emerging developments--including those in money, credit, and financial markets--rather than an intermeeting action based on an asymmetric directive. In the view of one member, a tightening action over the coming intermeeting period would incur an undue risk of an exaggerated response in financial markets, given the likelihood of thin trading markets around year-end; and since a policy move should be postponed, a symmetrical directive seemed appropriate.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two of the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a strong advance in economic activity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in November, and the civilian unemployment rate fell considerably to 6.4 percent. Industrial production increased sharply in October and November, partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales were up moderately in November after, a large increase in October. Housing starts advanced substantially in November. Business equipment expenditures have been rising rapidly, and nonresidential construction has turned up from depressed levels. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October was about unchanged from its average rate in the third quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices suggest little change in inflation trends, although prices of some raw materials have increased recently.  Short-term interest rates have changed little, while intermediate- and long-term rates have risen slightly since the Committee meeting on November 16. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in November, and both aggregates have risen at somewhat faster rates since late summer than earlier in the year. For the year through November, M2 and M3 are estimated to have grown at rates somewhat above the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through November it is estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases would persist over the balance of the year and that money growth within these lower ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, McTeer, Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.  Votes against this action: Messrs. Angell and Lindsey.  Messrs. Angell and Lindsey dissented because they believed that monetary policy was overly accommodative and needed to be adjusted promptly toward a more neutral stance to counter potential inflationary pressures in the economy. They referred to the long lags with which monetary policy exerts its effects on inflation and the consequent need to adjust monetary policy on a timely basis to foster the Committee's long-run objective of stable prices. They understood the difficulty of finding the appropriate circumstances for tightening actions so as to avoid unintended interpretations and repercussions in financial markets. In their judgment, economic and financial conditions were unlikely to be more favorable later and waiting risked undesirable inflationary consequences.  Mr. Angell also stressed that the Committee should focus more directly on forward-looking indicators such as the price of gold and the estimate of the natural rate of interest provided by the rate on five-year Treasury notes. He favored an immediate increase of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate, which would enable the Committee to observe how the market adjusted the price of gold to the changed opportunity cost of holding gold. He believed that if bond market participants concluded that the Committee was using the price of gold to target the price level, five-year and ten-year interest rates would then be significantly lower than if the Committee's tightening was a belated response to a worsening outlook for inflation. He emphasized that the objective of monetary policy clearly should be stable money which produces stable prices and an ongoing optimal and stable economic growth path.  Mr. Lindsey commented further that a modest policy move now would appropriately signal the Committee's concern about the potential for inflation. Such an action would begin the process of moving policy away from what he perceived as an unsustainable stance. He also noted that foreign competition had been restraining pressures on domestic prices, and the policy course he had in mind would continue to help in that regard by supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar.",199312,0,321,1993-12-31,0.37,0.25,0.06,0.01,0.69,0.56,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1993-12-21

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity recorded a strong advance during the closing months of 1993, and the limited data available on production and employment suggested appreciable further gains in the early weeks of this year. Housing starts had strengthened substantially in the fourth quarter of last year, and business fixed investment had registered a sharp rise. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding their food and energy components, had been somewhat larger in recent months than earlier in 1993, and prices of a number of commodities had turned up.  Assessment of the January labor market data was complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems, but a variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening in the demand for labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a small gain in January after a sizable December increase. Manufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month, with gains again concentrated in motor vehicles. Construction payrolls edged down, evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter weather. The total number of jobs in the services industries was unchanged in January, but the inclement weather apparently held down employment in some segments of this sector as well. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in January to its highest level in almost five years; for manufacturing, the average workweek remained at its post-World War II high for a third consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on a new basis, was 6.7 percent in January.  Industrial production increased appreciably further in December, and the available information suggested a considerable rise in January. In December, the advance in manufacturing was led by the motor vehicle and computing equipment industries. Sizable increases in materials and construction supplies also were recorded. On the other hand, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was sluggish, and the production of aircraft and defense and space equipment continued to shrink. Total utilization of manufacturing capacity rose again in December and reached a relatively high level, judged against historical experience.  Consumer spending, as measured by real personal consumption expenditures, posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter, and strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer demand. In the fourth quarter, real outlays on motor vehicles surged, and spending on other durable goods--notably furniture, appliances and other household equipment--registered further large gains. By contrast, real outlays for nondurable goods and services rose only moderately. Housing starts jumped in December, with both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance. For 1993 as a whole, housing starts were at their highest annual total in four years. Sales of new homes were up sharply in November, and sales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in the twenty-five year history of the series.  Real business fixed investment recorded a very large increase in the fourth quarter. Business spending for equipment, notably for information processing equipment, was up sharply for a seventh straight quarter. The strength evident in recent orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of these goods in early 1994. Outlays for nonresidential structures in the fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years; the increases were spread across a broad array of categories other than office buildings. Construction permits continued to rise in the fourth quarter, suggesting further growth of investment in nonresidential structures in the near term.  Business inventories remained generally well aligned with sales through November, the most recent month for which complete data were available. In manufacturing, inventory stocks fell in December after edging lower in November: with brisk gains in shipments in both months, the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that already were low by historical standards. At the wholesale level, inventories rose moderately in November after little change in the preceding two months. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector had changed little since May. Retail inventories expanded substantially in November for a third straight month. The buildup of stocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales, but for some retail businesses, particularly general merchandise stores, the increases coincided with weak sales. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in November.  The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for the October-November period was about the same as its average rate in the third quarter. The value of exports was up for the two-month period, with the increase occurring largely in machinery, automotive products, and aircraft. The higher value of imports for the two-month period reflected, as had been the case earlier in 1993, greater imports of consumer goods, automotive products, and machinery. Trends in economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have diverged further in the fourth quarter. Moderate growth appeared to be continuing in Canada and the United Kingdom, but economic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned down in Japan, western Germany, and France.  Producer prices of finished goods were down slightly in December after being unchanged in November. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in December and were up slightly for the year as a whole. At the retail level, consumer prices rose modestly in November and December, with energy price declines holding down the increase in the overall index. For items other than food and energy, prices advanced in the two months at a slightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year; for 1993 as a whole, the increase was about the same as in 1992. Hourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the fourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter. For 1993, the rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose sharply in January, but for the twelve months ended in January, the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on December 21, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the following months.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. Additional reserves were supplied to the banking system on a temporary basis around year-end to meet seasonal movements in currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for excess reserves. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated.  Most market interest rates declined slightly during the intermeeting period, and major indexes of stock prices posted new highs. Market participants saw the incoming news on inflation as encouraging; still, they viewed the economy as relatively robust, and on balance they deemed a firming of monetary policy to counteract a potential buildup of inflation pressures as likely in the next few months, but probably not in the very near term.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies changed little on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell against the yen in the context of somewhat higher Japanese interest rates and renewed expressions of U.S. concern about bilateral trade issues. The dollar appreciated slightly relative to the German mark and other European currencies against the background of relatively strong U.S. economic data and generally sluggish economic activity in continental Europe.  Growth of the broad monetary aggregates, though a little faster than in most of 1993, remained relatively slow over December and January. Investors evidently continued to find low-yielding deposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds, although recent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate than that seen over most of 1993. For the year 1993, growth of both M2 and M3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges. Private borrowing had picked up in recent months, and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat faster, though still moderate, pace in the fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth quarter, but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate somewhat in excess of the growth of potential. The severe winter weather over much of the country and the California earthquake would tend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year: however, taken together, these developments were not expected to have a material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or prices. Consumer spending, which for some time had tended to outpace the growth of disposable income, was projected to increase at a rate more in line with incomes. Business fixed investment was expected to decelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth, the slower growth of corporate cash flow, and a less rapid decline in the cost of capital. Homebuilding activity, driven by the greatly improved affordability of housing and increased confidence in employment prospects, was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace through much of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen somewhat, bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth, and fiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending. In light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon, the ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight further reduction in the core rate of inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the economy had entered the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat above the economy's long-run potential. The very rapid rate of economic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly could not be maintained. Much of the recent impetus to the expansion stemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing, business equipment, and consumer durables. Such spending had reached a very high level in relation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional increases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994. Still, the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum, largely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and generally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly accommodative monetary policy. As a consequence, a number of members expressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate growth forecast. In the context of low and decreasing slack in the economy, little further progress would be made toward price stability in 1994, and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some point if monetary policy were not adjusted. While broad measures of inflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation trends, some members noted that a number of commodity prices had turned up in recent months, and they referred to still scattered but increasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying slightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the production process.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for 1994. The central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat faster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for 1993. The anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to foster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the fourth quarter of this year. With the slack in productive resources expected to diminish further to a quite low level, price and cost pressures were unlikely to abate significantly: indeed, price increases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been held down by favorable developments in energy prices. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent and a full range of 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were all in a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent calculated on the basis of the new survey recently introduced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered on increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-1/4 to 4 percent, and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for the year.  In the Committee's review of factors underlying recent developments, members observed that generally favorable financial conditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion in business activity. Much of the recent strengthening in economic growth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low interest rates. Generally buoyant equity markets, a readier availability of financing from lending institutions, and the strengthened financial condition of businesses and households also were cited as factors tending to boost economic activity. Balance sheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly, and while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made, the latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the willingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to incur new debt to finance growing expenditures.  In their reports on developments across the nation, members commented on widespread indications of improving economic activity, including some strengthening in regions that earlier were characterized by stagnant business conditions. Some areas continued to be affected adversely by special factors, especially by spending cutbacks in defense and aerospace industries. California was a notable example, but a range of indicators suggested that the California economy might be stabilizing, albeit at a depressed level. after an extended period of declining activity. Mirroring these developments, business sentiment was characterized as generally optimistic around the nation. While business executives remained cautious in their hiring practices, the expansion in business activity was fostering sizable overall gains in employment even in areas where some major business concerns were reducing their workforces. A few large firms that previously had frozen or reduced their payrolls were now reported to be hiring additional workers.  Turning to prospective developments in key sectors of the economy, the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer expenditures would be well maintained during 1994, though the growth in such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with gains in disposable income. The available data on retail sales since the holiday period were still limited, but anecdotal reports pointed to continuing momentum in several parts of the country. Winter storms had hindered sales in a number of areas, but according to some retail contacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary. In any event, the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and other consumer durables were not sustainable, and already high consumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor. It was noted in this connection that consumer debt had become more concentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups that were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending, with the result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional indebtedness could be diminished. Higher taxes confronting some households also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the consumer sector. On balance, however, while the prospects for consumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty, the marked improvement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions would provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in consumer expenditures.  The improvement in consumer sentiment together with the availability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong growth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and, adjusting for seasonal weather conditions, anecdotal reports from many areas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the economy in the early weeks of this year. The strength in housing activity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other building materials, and shortages of skilled construction workers were reported in some areas. Despite these developments, prices of new homes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward pressure. Looking ahead, with housing construction already at high levels, further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be substantially below those recorded in recent quarters.  Business fixed investment was likely to be sustained by continuing efforts to modernize production facilities in order to achieve more efficient operations in highly competitive domestic and world markets. The gains in such investment had been concentrated in expenditures for equipment, and while new orders pointed to further brisk growth in the months ahead, increases in such expenditures were likely to moderate over time. At the same time, growing economic activity and associated declines in commercial and industrial vacancy rates, at least in some parts of the country, suggested that nonresidential building construction other than office structures would post sizable increases over the year. Rebuilding activity following the earthquake in California would stimulate engineering and construction in the Los Angeles area over the quarters ahead.  Fiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects on the economy in 1993. While the response of the economy to fiscal restraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to substantial uncertainty, both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were expected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance of the economy during 1994. With regard to the outlook for fiscal policy, the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate and to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal government expenditures on goods and services in 1994. It was noted that the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal government deficits could be expected to continue to contain new federal spending initiatives. With regard to the outlook for U.S. exports, more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were expected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth in major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the demand from those countries for U.S. goods and services. One member also commented that NAFTA already seemed to be having a favorable effect on some exports to Mexico.  One sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of particular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories. Business firms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories, and in general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales. Indeed, there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls had resulted in the loss of sales in recent months. Lean inventory levels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product markets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity pressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete existing inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to increase them. Thus far, there were few signs of developments such as significant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods purchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial inventory buildups. However, there were ample precedents in the history of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large inventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting inflationary pressures in the economy.  The members generally expressed concern about a buildup in inflationary pressures during the year ahead, especially if what they currently viewed as a very accommodative monetary policy were maintained. A number of members emphasized that even with the substantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic expansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter, overall margins of slack in labor and product markets, already reduced to fairly modest levels, would shrink further in the quarters ahead with the clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation would emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions. Continuing upward impetus to food prices, resulting from the adverse weather conditions during 1993, and the likelihood that energy prices would not decline further and might in fact turn up in an environment of somewhat stronger worldwide demand for energy products could add to overall price pressures.  The members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and wages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the whole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends. However, some other indicators were more disquieting. One example was the growing, though still limited, number of anecdotal reports of shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or occupations, notably construction. Moreover, there were more reports of rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for use in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by businesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs or to improve their profit margins. More generally, many commodity prices had increased over the past several weeks. On the positive side, competitive pressures remained intense in many markets, augmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign producers. Some members also commented that the tradeoff between economic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to the extent that the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy was maintained.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less accommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with regard to the amount of the adjustment. The current policy posture, which had been in effect since the late summer of 1992, was highly stimulative as evidenced, for example, by very low or even slightly negative real short-term interest rates and, in the view of at least some members, the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in narrow measures of money and reserves. Such a policy had been appropriate in a period when various developments had tended to inhibit the expansion, including widespread efforts to repair strained balance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that had tended to depress confidence and spending. More recently, the considerable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing their debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions of lending institutions had provided a financial basis, in the context of low interest rates, for growth in demands on productive capacity that could generate inflation pressures. In this situation, the members agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more neutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without a buildup of inflationary imbalances. The members recognized that timely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous and disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were allowed to intensify. The history of past cyclical upswings had demonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on economic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of members endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight adjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure. These members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well justify a somewhat greater policy adjustment. They believed, however, that even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly strong impact on financial markets because it would be the first policy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening action in about five years. The market effect might be amplified by a contemplated decision to authorize the Chairman to announce the policy action (discussed below). In the circumstances, these members felt that a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable risk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets. A relatively small move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the Committee's anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further action should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation expectations and speculative developments in financial markets.  Other members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater firming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable neutral stance. In this view, recent developments in the economy had demonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that slow, gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to build. A more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact reduce uncertainty, because fewer discrete actions would be required and they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing inflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on longer-term interest rates over time. The result would be a policy stance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and progress toward price stability.  In further discussion, all the members indicated that they could accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point, but many observed that additional firming probably would be desirable later. The members did not see any unusual likelihood that a further policy action would be needed during the intermeeting period, and the Committee therefore decided to retain an unbiased intermeeting instruction in the directive. In this connection, it was understood that the Committee would be prepared to review its policy stance and take further action, if warranted by intermeeting developments, at a telephone conference during the period ahead.  At this meeting, Committee members discussed and agreed on a proposal to have the Chairman announce the Committee's short-term policy decision promptly. The purpose of such an announcement, which would be a departure from past Committee practice, was to avoid any misinterpretation of the Committee's action and its purpose. Because this would be the first tightening policy action in a long time, it was likely to attract considerable attention. The Committee did not intend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any commitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future. That matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the disclosure of Committee information at a later meeting.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the Committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates a strong advance in economic activity during the closing months of 1993, and the limited data available for the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable further gains. The January labor market data were complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems; however, a variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a continuing expansion of employment. Industrial production increased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to have risen considerably further in January. Consumer spending and housing activity posted solid gains in late 1993, and strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer demand. Trends in contracts and orders point to further sizable gains in business fixed investment. The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October-November was about the same as its average rate in the third quarter. Over the latter part of 1993, increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding their food and energy components, were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and prices of a number of commodities also turned up recently.  Most market interest rates have declined slightly since the Committee meeting on December 21. 1993. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is about unchanged over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 was relatively slow over December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993, M2 and M3 are estimated to have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Private borrowing has picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt is estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity had expanded appreciably further in the early months of 1994, despite unusually severe winter weather. Consumer spending and construction activity had been held down to some extent by the adverse weather conditions, but motor vehicle production had continued at a very strong pace and business fixed investment appeared to be headed for a significant gain in the first quarter. Factory utilization rates had moved still higher, and labor demand seemed to have grown moderately further. Outside of a surge in energy prices, increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained moderate.  Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but posted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases recorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service industries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially in February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but the number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting that industry's vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in February: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a variety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in joblessness in early 1994.  After a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial production increased considerably further in January and February. Manufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping effect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of motor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half of the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of the year and reaching in February their highest level since the late 1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles also was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than those of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting the heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but a portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of industrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at relatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating rates in primary processing industries were especially high.  Retail sales were little changed on balance over the first two months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large January decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite brisk on average over the two months, despite the California earthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating contributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in January. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts were down considerably in January and February from the very high levels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of existing homes in January were only slightly below their high December level.  The limited available evidence pointed to a noticeably smaller gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter of 1994 after a very large increase in the previous quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods slowed in January, retracing part of the sharp rise of the fourth quarter, but the buoyancy of orders in recent months pointed to a further increase in shipments in coming months. Sales of heavy trucks were strong in January, and the backlog of orders for such vehicles remained large. Nonresidential construction activity, perhaps owing in part to bad weather, was down in January after trending up over most of 1993. The largest decline was in office building, which had posted large increases in the preceding two months.  Business inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks were lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in manufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December decline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At both the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable decreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio edged down and had changed little since May of last year. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly, reflecting weak sales in January.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services, measured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in January than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January deficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports down by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in agricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly reflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The limited available data suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed performance in the fourth quarter of 1993.  Producer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil, that more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February: for the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by a significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended in February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in February were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food and energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months ended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly in February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance was about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on February 3-4, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.  Immediately following the February meeting, Chairman Greenspan announced the Committee's decision, and open market operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less accommodative degree of reserve pressures sought by the Committee. The federal funds rate increased by 1/4 percentage point and then remained close to 3-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period, while adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged a little less than anticipated.  Most other market interest rates rose considerably more than the federal funds rate in frequently volatile markets. Market participants generally had anticipated a tightening of monetary policy, but the Committee's action apparently came a little sooner than had been expected. Strong fourth-quarter economic data and evidence of solid growth in early 1994 were seen as suggesting greater credit demands and the need for higher interest rates in the future to contain inflation. Heightened trade tensions and unsettled market conditions abroad also contributed to market concerns. In these circumstances, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates increased by appreciably more than short-term money market rates. Major indexes of stock prices had fallen on balance since early February in sometimes volatile trading.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary policy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the intermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and the release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic activity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the German mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and disappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to be contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond yields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average by almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds.  M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A substantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that depressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected by a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors reacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads between returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term instruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both monetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that involved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker inflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth quarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly in excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some restraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less rapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow. Homebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing and the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes. The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were expected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further reduction in the core rate of inflation was expected.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of appreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins of unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members continued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the very rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite unusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the deceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had expected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand along with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much reduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members continued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a time at a rate somewhat above the economy's potential. The amount of resources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was subject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the economy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to relatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate outlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being contained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for productivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad where slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and credit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained moderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead, members were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources would intensify and inflation would pick up.  Members assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices against the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent, equity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening of reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in market movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members variously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates had reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about the course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and foreign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary participants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance, financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions; however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and consumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was described as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although there were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented on numerous indications of improving regional economies.  A number of members observed that they expected consumer spending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable strength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer durables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country tended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers were expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the same time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely to limit the potential strength of consumer spending. They referred in particular to the already low saving rate, relatively high consumer indebtedness, and recent declines in the value of securities held by households. More importantly, however, consumer confidence and spending would continue to depend heavily on the outlook for further growth in employment and incomes.  Business investment expenditures remained on a solid uptrend as firms continued to focus on the need to control costs and improve operating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competitive pressures. Members also cited some examples of investment spending induced by rising demands pressing against limitations in production capacity. While business investment had tended to be concentrated in new, more productive equipment, nonresidential construction also had strengthened and anecdotal reports from numerous areas tended to confirm more positive nationwide statistics. The rising levels of nonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in commercial and industrial facilities and public works projects; the construction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector appeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a long period of decline. More generally, currently positive business attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business investment, but on the negative side it was noted that further turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse implications for investment spending. Residential construction was described as quite strong in numerous areas, although overall housing construction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter weather in numerous parts of the country. Shortages of skilled construction workers and building materials were reported in many areas.  Despite generally rising final demands, business firms were continuing to maintain lean inventory positions in their ongoing efforts to hold down costs. Nonetheless, with production levels in many industries approaching or reaching full capacity utilization, prices of some materials and other business purchases coming under increasing pressure, and delivery lead times tending to lengthen at least in some industries, efforts to build inventories could be expected to materialize and in one view the potential for such a development represented a key upside risk from current forecasts. In this connection, some members referred to scattered indications of efforts to increase inventories, notably of steel products. Manufacturers of motor vehicles also were in the process of rebuilding depleted inventories, though the currently stimulative impact of such rebuilding on overall production was likely to be reversed when motor vehicle stocks reached desired levels in the months ahead.  The foreign trade sector was expected to remain a negative factor in the economic outlook. However, the members anticipated some improvement in the economies of major foreign industrial nations which, together with some moderation in the growth of domestic final demands, was likely to slow the decline in real net exports. A few members cited growing indications that last year's NAFTA legislation would have quite positive effects on U.S. foreign trade, though those effects were still largely in the future.  In the discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, many of the members expressed concern about the potential for a pickup in inflation if, as they anticipated, margins of unemployed resources narrowed further or disappeared. The members acknowledged that broad measures of prices relating to final purchases and of wages currently did not suggest any increase in inflation. Indeed, in the view of at least some members, those measures still suggested on balance that the inflation trend had retained a downward tilt thus far. In this connection, some commented that the overall performance of the broad measures had been somewhat better in recent months than they had anticipated, especially given the very rapid expansion of the economy over the closing months of 1993 and the less than expected moderation thus far this year. Developments that had been exerting a favorable effect on prices included above-trend growth in productivity, relatively low prices in world oil markets, and strong competition in many markets from both domestic and foreign firms. Moreover, the strong rise in credit usage that often had accompanied intensified inflation pressures in the past had yet to materialize. To date, the pickup in price increases had been uneven and had tended to be concentrated in some regions or industries and in the early stages of the production process, and a number of members reported that they saw little change in inflation trends in their areas. Nonetheless, warning signs had emerged of the prospect of greater inflation, though perhaps not over the nearer term. These included increases in a wide range of commodity prices and anecdotal reports from various parts of the country suggesting a further rise in the number of business firms that were facing somewhat higher prices of materials and other purchases and in turn were able, often for the first time in recent years, to raise their selling prices. Price and wage pressures appeared to be especially pronounced in the construction industry, where capacity constraints had been encountered in many localities. Members also referred to the potential for higher prices in the food and energy sectors; low crop carryovers for some grains made food prices vulnerable to unfavorable growing conditions, should they materialize; oil prices currently were at relative lows but were likely to come under some upward pressures as world economic growth accelerated and if political developments led to disruptions in world supplies. More fundamentally, the relatively robust economic expansion over the second half of 1993 and the further advance in early 1994 appeared in the view of many members to have appreciably diminished the gap between actual and potential GDP and to have reduced the rate of unemployment to a level that could well be not far from the natural rate. If this assessment proved to be correct, further economic expansion at a pace above the economy's potential would bring more industries and the economy more generally to capacity production levels before very long and could well-generate growing inflation thereafter.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less accommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had been made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary policy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low inflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an indicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also referred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money over an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum. In the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy could be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor and capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While actual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped, it was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy induced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of inflation.  In these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary policy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be defined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with changing circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual approach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as a policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary expansion consistent with the economy's potential. The members generally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance away, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.  As had been the case at the February meeting, views differed on how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this meeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would have to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given underlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference for another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a possible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite sensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some emphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate of economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the expansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was currently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable to permit an assessment of ongoing developments.  Members who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or perhaps a small move through open market operations that was associated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the increasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more promptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become overly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would serve to underscore the Committee's commitment to its price stability objective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted as a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier in the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have beneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view of some members, continued market expectations of further actions to tighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market instability. Some members also commented that any policy choice incurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest risk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary pressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led to the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more readily and with less damage to the economy in this view.  In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. While the probability of an easing action during this period was deemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any firming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented after today's meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of moving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more neutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not independent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not as dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at other times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did not rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the past when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members who favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive seemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy toward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to indications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated, however, that they could support a symmetric directive that was associated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations.  At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all but two of the members indicated that they could accept a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has expanded appreciably further in the early months of 1994. Severe weather and changes in statistical methodology distorted movements in official labor market data in January and February, but it appears that employment increased somewhat on balance over the two months and that unemployment fell. Industrial production also increased substantially over this period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending and housing activity apparently have been held down to some extent by adverse weather in January and February: retail sales were little changed on balance over the two months and housing starts fell considerably. Trends in contracts and orders point to a sizable increase in business fixed investment but at a rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in January was slightly smaller than the average in the fourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months despite a surge in energy prices.  Most market interest rates have risen considerably since the Committee meeting on February 3-4, 1994. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated over the intermeeting period.  M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February, but data for early March point to some rebound in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.  Votes against this action: Messrs. Broaddus, and Jordan.  Messrs. Broaddus and Jordan dissented because they preferred a stronger move toward a more neutral policy stance. In their view, the recent sharp increases in longer-term interest rates indicated clearly that inflationary expectations were rising and that the principal policy risk had become one of remaining accommodative for too long a period. In this environment, they believed that a more aggressive move would underscore the Committee's commitment to fostering sustainable longer-term growth and reduce the risk that a highly restrictive policy might be required at a later date to contain inflation.",199403,0,324,1994-03-31,0.57,0.48,0.05,0.29,1.39,0.59,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1994-03-22

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded substantially on balance thus far in 1994. Favorable business expectations and buoyant consumer sentiment in the context of stronger gains in employment appeared to have sustained strong growth in domestic final demand. Broad measures of inflation had remained subdued and labor cost increases had been moderate, though prices of industrial materials had continued to rise.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in March and April, in part reflecting a rebound in industries affected by earlier severe winter weather; for the first four months of the year, the average monthly rise exceeded the improved pace of the fourth quarter. Further large advances in employment in the March-April period were recorded in the services sector, notably at personnel supply services firms; hiring in construction was strong after earlier weather-related losses; and the number of jobs in manufacturing continued to expand, although at a somewhat slower pace than in previous months. The civilian unemployment rate registered another slight decline in April, to 6.4 percent, and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at an unusually high level.  Industrial production was up appreciably further in April, with increases widespread across sectors. The pace of motor vehicle assemblies slowed, but much of the indicated slowdown reflected the effects of seasonal adjustment, which called for increases at a time when manufacturing operations already were at levels close to capacity. Output of public utilities fell again, as electricity generation dropped with the return to less severe weather patterns. Rates of industrial capacity utilization had risen rapidly in recent months and were at very high levels in many industries--especially in motor vehicles, petroleum refining, lumber, and primary metals.  Retail sales were estimated to have fallen in April after two months of very large increases. Despite the April decline, which was widespread by type of retail outlet, outlays were considerably above the first-quarter average. Sales of new and existing homes posted significant gains in March although they remained below their fourth-quarter averages. Housing starts decreased slightly in April but were well above the depressed winter pace. The third consecutive monthly gain in multifamily starts was more than offset by a decline in single-family starts.  Real business fixed investment continued to increase rapidly in the first quarter, but at a less robust pace than in the fourth quarter of 1993. Outlays for producers durable equipment posted another sizable advance, spending for computing equipment surged again, and purchases of most other types of equipment also continued to trend up. Moreover, business demand for automobiles and trucks remained strong. Outlays for nonresidential structures declined sharply in the first quarter, although construction activity showed some recovery in March after the disruptions associated with severe weather during January and February.  Business inventories declined in March, reversing part of the large run-up in stocks that had occurred in the first two months of the year. For the first quarter as a whole, inventories rose at a slightly slower pace than in the second half of last year. In manufacturing, the accumulation in the first quarter retraced much of the drawdown that had taken place in previous months; the inventory-to-shipments ratio, already at a low level, edged still lower. Wholesale inventories were down on balance over the first quarter, with a large March decline more than retracing increases earlier in the year; the ratio of inventories to sales was well below the range prevailing over the last several years. Retail inventories expanded modestly in the first quarter, and the inventory-to-sales ratio fell slightly.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger on average in January and February than it had been in the fourth quarter. The value of exports in the January-February period was sharply below the unusually strong level in the fourth quarter but was slightly higher than the levels recorded in the first three quarters of 1993. Exports were down in virtually all major trade categories; one important exception was semiconductors, for which exports continued to trend higher. Imports in the two-month period fell by less than exports; nearly all of the decline reflected reduced oil imports. Available indicators for the first quarter pointed to recovery in economic activity at a moderate pace on average in the major foreign industrial countries. Signs of recovery ranged from quite tentative in Japan to relatively well-established in the United Kingdom and Canada.  Indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased slightly thus far in 1994. In April, consumer prices posted their smallest rise since January; food prices were up a bit further, but energy prices retraced their March run-up. Excluding the food and energy components of the index, consumer prices edged up in April, and over the twelve months ending in April these prices increased less than they had over the previous twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods declined a little in April as prices of finished foods and energy moved down; for items other than food and energy, prices were up slightly in April and for the twelve months ending in April. At earlier stages of processing, the index of producer prices of crude materials other than food and energy was substantially above its year-ago level, despite a small drop in April. At the intermediate stage, the prices of some important construction materials had increased sharply although, overall, prices of nonfood, non-energy goods had risen only modestly over the past twelve months.  Increases in labor costs continued to moderate in early 1994. The employment cost index for private industry workers rose more slowly in the first quarter of 1994 than in any quarter of 1993. The slowdown reflected more moderate growth in both wages and salaries and benefit costs. Hourly compensation increased at a slightly slower pace over the twelve months ending in March 1994 than over the previous year. In April, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm payrolls increased moderately after having changed little over February and March.  At its meeting on March 22, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.  Immediately after the meeting, open market operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less accommodative degree of reserve pressure sought by the Committee. Subsequently, on April 18, against the background of incoming data suggesting considerable momentum and diminishing slack in the economy and of indications that financial markets were less likely to be destabilized by a further policy action, the degree of accommodation in reserve pressures was reduced a little further. The federal funds rate rose 1/4 percentage point, to 3-1/2 percent, after the initial policy action; following the second policy move, the funds rate went up another 1/4 percentage point and generally remained near 3-3/4 percent. Over the intermeeting period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged slightly above anticipated levels.  Most market interest rates increased by more than the federal funds rate over the period since the March meeting, with the largest increases occurring at intermediate maturities. Weakness in the dollar as well as the release of data suggesting considerable vigor in economic activity appeared to have contributed to the upward pressure on market rates. The bank prime rate was raised 3/4 percentage point, to 6-3/4 percent, while major indexes of stock prices fell substantially.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat further on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar's depreciation occurred despite the implementation of less accommodative policy actions in the United States and monetary easing moves in several key foreign countries. Market concerns about political developments in Japan as well as a worsened outlook for progress toward more open trading relationships and for a more stimulative fiscal policy in that country contributed to downward pressure on the dollar. Against the backdrop of a falling dollar, U.S. authorities conducted intervention operations on April 29 and again on May 4. The latter operations were coupled with a statement by Treasury Secretary Bentsen indicating that intervention was being undertaken in response to recent movements in exchange markets that had gone beyond what could be justified by economic fundamentals and was being conducted in concert with operations by other major countries. Subsequent to these actions, the dollar retraced part of its earlier decline.  Growth of M2 and M3 turned up, on balance, in March and April despite the rising short-term opportunity costs of holding deposits. The strengthening of these aggregates seemed to be related to a reassessment by households of the relative attractiveness of investing in capital market instruments; capital losses sparked substantial net redemptions at bond mutual funds over March and April that were accompanied by a surge in flows to retail money market funds and slower runoffs of small time deposits. For the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range for 1994, and M3 at a pace somewhat above the lower end of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate rate over recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity, after rebounding from the disruptions caused by adverse weather conditions earlier in the year, would expand in the second half of 1994 at a rate close to the growth of the economy's potential. Consumer spending, which had outpaced gains in household income for some time, was projected to slow to a growth rate more in line with the expansion of income; with pent-up demands apparently reduced and somewhat higher interest rates exerting a damping effect, much of the slowing was expected to be centered on outlays for durable goods. Business fixed investment would be restrained by the slower growth of business output and the associated moderation of corporate cash flows but would continue to advance at a faster rate than overall economic activity. Homebuilding was projected to remain at a pace that was relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years, though a bit below that of the fourth quarter. The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand was expected to diminish somewhat. In light of limited margins of slack in labor and product markets over the forecast horizon, little or no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members commented on widespread indications, both statistical and anecdotal, of considerable momentum in the economic expansion. Business activity seemed to be rebounding smartly from the disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather, and it appeared that the expansion over the first half of the year was likely to be a little stronger than had been expected at the time of the March meeting. A deceleration in activity still seemed to be in train for the second half, but the extent of such a slowing was an important source of uncertainty in the outlook. The members continued to see moderate growth at a rate in line with or slightly above the economy's potential as the most likely prospect, but the overall momentum of the expansion and the still accommodative stance of monetary policy suggested that there was an appreciable risk of faster growth for a period, with consequent implications for greater pressures on resources. At the same time, the members saw relatively few signs of the kinds of imbalances that would pose a significant downside potential for the economy, although some cautioned that the rise in long-term interest rates, recently weaker data on production and sales, and continuing anxiety about job security in an environment of corporate restructuring contributed elements of fragility to what was otherwise a healthy outlook. The near-term prospects for inflation were favorable. Wage and price trends generally remained moderate; the persisting high rate of business investment bode well for further enhancements of productivity; and competitive pressures, including those from imported goods, were restraining efforts by firms to raise prices. The members were concerned, however, that in an environment in which slack in the economy already had been reduced to a fairly low level and could decline further in the quarters ahead, inflation could begin to rise unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its accommodative stance.  In their comments about developments across the nation, members took note of the considerable strength in economic conditions in many parts of the country. However, they also recognized that some parts of the nation were experiencing relatively subdued growth and that economic activity remained depressed in other areas such as Southern California and Hawaii. The strong forward momentum in the economy was most clearly evident in interest-sensitive sectors, including motor vehicles, other durable goods, and housing. The rise in interest rates over the course of recent months was cited by business contacts as a potential source of restraint on interest-sensitive expenditures, but thus far relatively few contacts had reported actual examples of adverse interest-rate effects on spending. While higher rates would constrain aggregate demand going forward, their effects probably would be offset in part by more aggressive lending practices at banks and other institutions. At the same time, reports of industries that were operating at or near capacity limits were becoming more numerous, and capacity constraints were said to be limiting some sales.  With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, consumer expenditures were viewed by many members as likely to be well maintained, particularly for motor vehicles and other consumer durables. Reports from various parts of the country indicated that sales had tended in many areas to exceed retailers' expectations by a considerable margin in recent months. Some members noted, however, that sales had been less ebullient since late winter and cited factors that might work to restrain somewhat the growth of consumer spending. These included high and rising debt levels, declines in household wealth owing to the drop in stock and bond prices, and the effects on consumer confidence of ongoing workforce reductions associated with business restructuring. Higher interest rates also might limit the pace at which pent-up demands would continue to be satisfied. On balance, in the view of a number of members, growth in consumer spending seemed likely to moderate to a pace close to the growth in incomes.  Members expected business fixed investment to continue to expand at a pace substantially above that of the economy as a whole. With production straining capacity limits in a number of industries and firms striving for cost savings and productivity improvements to maintain their competitiveness, real outlays for producers' durable equipment were likely to stay on a strong upward trend despite an anticipated deceleration in business output and the recently increased cost of external capital associated with higher interest rates and lower equity prices. It was noted in this connection that order books at producers of capital equipment had grown considerably. Nonresidential construction appeared to be rebounding from the disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather conditions; however, the pattern of construction activity across the nation was mixed, with some areas of the country displaying considerable strength in activity and other areas still depressed. The construction of office buildings for the most part remained at very low levels, but anecdotal reports indicated that markets for office space, especially those that had been hard hit in recent years, seemed to be improving considerably in some locales. Business inventories remained quite lean by historical standards, and some reports suggested that efforts to augment stocks had been negated by strong sales. With survey reports indicating that order backlogs had grown and lead times on materials deliveries had lengthened, the possibility was increasing that desired inventory ratios might be adjusted upward and some pickup in inventory investment might get under way, especially in manufacturing where stocks-to-sales ratios recently had fallen to new lows.  Residential construction was indicated to be robust across much of the country, with activity picking up rapidly in the aftermath of the unusually severe winter. The affordability of housing remained high by historical standards, and the appeal of home ownership had been enhanced somewhat by the apparent firming of house prices over the past year. In these circumstances, housing activity had been well sustained, although there were some indications that the higher mortgage rates now prevailing had begun to damp residential investment.  The foreign trade sector was expected to continue to exert some drag on economic growth, but the members saw this as likely to lessen as an anticipated gradual pickup in economic activity among key trading partners bolstered demand for U.S. exports while imports were restrained by a projected moderation in the growth of U.S. domestic demand. In the view of one member, the export sector would tend to sustain and perhaps become an important stimulus to growth in the United States as earlier declines in the dollar, taken in conjunction with technological improvements and higher product quality, enhanced the competitiveness of U.S. exports.  In their discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, the members noted that broad measures of inflation remained subdued and increases in labor costs had been moderate. Nevertheless, they continued to be concerned that inflation could begin to rise if growth in excess of potential were to persist and margins of unutilized production resources were to shrink further, or even disappear. Production already had reached capacity limits in a number of industries, including motor vehicles and steel, and prices of some raw materials and intermediate goods had risen substantially over the past year. Ongoing efforts to expand production capacity through productivity-enhancing investment and the hiring of additional workers were likely to be of some help in meeting growing demands, but an increasing number of contacts were reporting that business firms were taking advantage of opportunities to adjust prices upward. There also were indications of shortages of qualified workers in some labor markets or industries, but to date there were only limited signs of upward wage pressures and these did not seem to signal a near-term emergence of general upward cost pressures on prices. Indeed, even with sales strong, many business contacts were reporting that intense competition, in part from imports, was curbing or negating efforts to raise prices. Firms were continuing to look primarily to improvements in productivity and quality to bolster their profit margins, although there also were reports that price discounting was lessening and that sales promotions were becoming less frequent. Price and wage pressures were most clearly evident and widespread in the construction industry, where resource constraints appeared to be most pronounced.  In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the period until the meeting in early July, the members favored prompt further action to remove much of the remaining accommodation in the stance of monetary policy, at least as measured by real short-term interest rates. Many members commented that the expansion was on a solid and self-sustaining basis and appeared to have more underlying strength than they had foreseen earlier. The stimulative effects of an expansionary monetary policy had become increasingly apparent--especially in business purchases of capital equipment and consumer spending on housing, motor vehicles, and other consumer durables. At the same time, the constraints on economic expansion that had been associated with business restructuring activities, widespread efforts to strengthen balance sheets, and other retarding forces had diminished considerably. The financial health of the banking system was greatly improved, and banking institutions had evidenced a growing willingness to make new loans. Moreover, the demand for bank loans, which had been sluggish for several years, now appeared to be on the rise. While a series of small steps earlier this year had already reduced the degree of accommodation in monetary policy and inflation was subdued for the time being, the members were concerned that continued policy accommodation could be expected to lead before long to growing pressures on production resources and to a fresh outbreak of inflation.  In the circumstances, all the members agreed that a further tightening action was needed at this point; and, in order to better assure that the remaining degree of policy accommodation had been largely removed, the adjustment should fully reflect the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that the Board of Governors was expected to approve later in the day. The actions taken earlier in the year had been modest in size because of concerns that more aggressive steps might generate substantial uncertainty and undue disruptions in financial markets, with adverse consequences for the economy. Even though financial markets remained volatile, speculative sentiment and holdings seemed to have been reduced to a marked extent, and financial markets appeared to be in a much better position to absorb needed policy adjustments. Accordingly, a stronger action probably would not produce an unduly adverse market response and could well have a settling effect on the markets. A number of members cautioned that the Committee could not be sure that today's policy actions, along with those implemented earlier this year, had produced a policy stance that would foster economic growth at a sustainable, non-inflationary pace. Thus, the Committee would have to remain alert to economic and financial developments that might signal the need for further tightening.  In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, all but one of the members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. Symmetry would be consistent with a judgment that further policy adjustment likely would not be needed during the intermeeting period ahead and, in particular, that additional tightening would not be triggered unless inflation pressures greater than those currently anticipated were to emerge. The adoption of a symmetric directive would not preclude an intermeeting consultation and possible adjustment by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee if such were warranted by intermeeting developments. One member expressed a preference for an asymmetric directive. In his view, a symmetric directive might be mistakenly interpreted both in the United States and abroad as a signal that the Committee believed that policy neutrality definitely had been achieved and that there was no need to allow for the possibility of further tightening.  At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all the members indicated they could support a directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate, and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has expanded substantially on balance thus far in 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in March and April, in part reflecting a rebound in sectors affected by severe winter weather; the civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further in April, to 6.4 percent. Industrial production was up appreciably in April after a strong rise over the previous two quarters. Advance data on retail sales indicate a decline in April, after very large increases in February and March. Housing starts fell slightly in April but remained well above the depressed winter pace. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending on business equipment, while nonresidential building has shown some recovery after severe weather disrupted construction during January and February. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened on average in January and February from the fourth-quarter rate. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained moderate through April, though prices of industrial materials continued to rise.  Market interest rates have posted large additional increases since the Committee meeting on March 22, 1994. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat further on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up on average in March and April; for the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range for 1994 and M3 at a pace somewhat above the bottom of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second quarter. Although consumer spending and homebuying apparently had increased at a slower pace, business spending on durable equipment remained quite strong and investment in nonresidential structures rebounded from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. In addition, the rate of nonfarm inventory investment evidently had picked up in the second quarter. Levels of resource utilization had risen further: factory operating rates were at relatively high levels, and the slack in labor markets had narrowed considerably over the first half of the year to what appeared to be very low levels. Increases in consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in recent months, but prices of many basic industrial materials had risen.  Nonfarm payroll employment advanced somewhat less rapidly in May after the brisk increases of recent months; however, the average workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers reached its highest level since 1987. The reduction in job gains was widespread by sector--including business services; finance, insurance, and real estate; manufacturing; and construction. Employment in transportation rebounded, reflecting the end of a Teamsters strike. The civilian unemployment rate, measured on the new basis introduced in January, declined sharply in May, to 6.0 percent; the decline might have been overstated as a result of seasonal adjustment problems, but even after correcting for these factors, the unemployment rate had fallen sharply since late 1993.  The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May after strong first-quarter gains. Much of the slowing was the result of capacity constraints that prevented normal seasonal increases in the production of motor vehicles. Growth of output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts was at a slightly less robust pace than in the first quarter but close to the rapid rate seen in 1993; business equipment and construction supplies continued to be areas of strength. The overall rate of utilization in manufacturing stayed at a high level in May, with most major industry groups operating at or near capacity. In addition to motor vehicles, capacity constraints were evident in the petroleum products and nonelectrical machinery industry groups and in some individual product lines in other industries.  Real personal consumption expenditures fell on balance in April and May after a strong advance earlier in the year, but the level of expenditures for the two months combined was a little above the first-quarter average. The recent slowdown in consumer spending in large part reflected reduced outlays for motor vehicles. Spending for durable goods other than motor vehicles increased over April and May at about the first-quarter pace. Outlays for nondurable goods were down on balance in April and May, while spending for services in May more than reversed a small April decline. Housing activity had rebounded from weather disruptions early in the year to a pace close to the elevated fourth-quarter rate. Single-family starts edged down in May after declining substantially in April but were still at a relatively high level. While the cash-flow affordability of home ownership had fallen since late last year, it remained at favorable levels in comparison with recent years. Multifamily starts in May were at their highest level in more than three years; most of the pickup occurred in the South, where vacancy rates had declined recently.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and parts posted a further solid gain in May, although the upward trend appeared to have moderated in recent months. Sales of heavy trucks also were strong in April and May. Shipments of aircraft declined sharply in April (latest available data), retracing much of a March surge. Available data on orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to a continued strong uptrend in business spending on durable equipment. Nonresidential construction picked up in April and May from a weather-depressed slump in the first quarter.  Business inventories increased in April, more than reversing a March runoff; the overall pace of accumulation remained moderate, and buildups were largely concentrated in segments of the economy where market demand was robust. In manufacturing, inventories increased in April and May after a small drawdown in March. The rise in stocks was in line with shipments, and the ratio of stocks to shipments stayed at a very low level. In April (latest available data), wholesale inventories retraced most of the sizable March drawdown. The ratio of inventories to sales in this sector remained below the range that has prevailed in recent years. At the retail level, inventory stocks again edged higher; the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was well within the range observed over the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April but was little changed from the average for the first quarter; over the first four months of 1994, the deficit was significantly larger than that recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. The value of exports of goods and services was down somewhat in April, retracing part of a sharp runup in March. The uptrend in exports since last fall has been led by shipments of machinery, especially to expanding markets in Asia. The value of imports of goods and services was about the same in April as in March; increases in consumer goods, machinery, and oil were offset by declines in other categories. The economies of all the major foreign industrial countries expanded in the first quarter of 1994. Growth resumed in Japan, western Germany, and France, while economic expansion continued at a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada.  Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had risen moderately through the first five months of the year. In May, the rise in the overall index of consumer prices continued to be held down by declines in energy prices. Excluding the food and energy components, the increase in consumer prices in the twelve months ending in May was smaller than that for the previous twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods continued to edge lower in May, reflecting further declines in prices of finished foods and energy goods. Producer prices for items other than food and energy increased at a faster rate in May, but the change over the twelve-month period ending in May was very small. At an earlier stage of processing, producer prices of crude materials other than food and energy registered another small decline in May, although the index was substantially higher in May than a year ago. Furthermore, prices of many basic industrial materials had remained under upward pressure. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased by a larger amount in May than in April, but the rise over the twelve months ended in May was about the same as in the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on May 17, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. The directive did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any further adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Immediately after the conclusion of the May meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate, to 3-1/2 percent, and the Committee permitted the full amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in reserve markets. Thereafter, open market operations were conducted with a view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of reserve pressure sought by the Committee. After the policy change, the federal funds rate rose 1/2 percentage point, to 4-1/4 percent, and remained at about that level over the intermeeting period. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended higher over the intermeeting period, reflecting the usual seasonal pickup in lending activity, and averaged close to anticipated levels.  Market interest rates on instruments with more than three-month maturities moved lower immediately following the announcement of the Committee's action, although some very short-term interest rates moved up. The commercial bank prime rate also was raised by 1/2 percentage point, to 7-1/4 percent. Market participants apparently interpreted the policy actions and the accompanying announcement as signaling that the System would not take further tightening actions as soon as they had anticipated earlier. Incoming data suggesting sluggish spending and subdued inflation tended to confirm these market assessments. Late in the intermeeting period, however, bond yields retraced these declines, partly in association with a weakening dollar in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. Most major indexes of equity prices rose early in the intermeeting period, but they then moved lower in sympathy with the declines in bond prices and the dollar and ended the period with small losses.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell significantly further on balance over the intermeeting period. The renewed decline, which began toward the middle of June, occurred in response to indications of an improved economic outlook abroad, associated increases in foreign bond yields, and heightened concerns about possible increases in U.S. inflation. Developments suggesting less favorable prospects for progress in U.S. Japanese trade negotiations also tended to strengthen the yen against the dollar.  The broad monetary aggregates were weaker than the Committee anticipated at the time of its previous meeting, with both M2 and M3 declining on average over May and June. The declines appeared to be related in part to the continuing appeal of capital market instruments. More generally, however, the rise in short-and long-term interest rates since the beginning of 1994, coupled with the reluctance of banks and other depository institutions to adjust their offering rates promptly, had produced a widening of the opportunity costs of holding deposits and had led households to move deposit monies into direct and indirect holdings of market instruments. For the year through June, both M2 and M3 were at the bottom of the Committee's ranges for 1994, and total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded at a moderate rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy was operating at a level close to capacity and that the expansion would slow over the next several quarters to a rate generally in line with the growth of the economy's potential. To the extent that aggregate demand tended to expand at a pace that could foster higher inflation, it would not be accommodated by monetary policy, and pressures would be generated in financial markets that would restrain domestic spending. Consumer spending, which had been increasing faster than household income for some time, was expected to moderate as smaller gains in employment and income, coupled with higher interest rates and reductions in the value of household financial assets, exerted a restraining influence on consumption patterns. Business fixed investment was projected to continue at a brisk pace, although growth would be damped somewhat by the expected deceleration in economic activity, a growing shortfall of corporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs. The effects of higher mortgage interest rates were expected to cause some slowing in the relatively robust pace of single-family homebuilding. The restraint on output growth exerted by weak export demand was expected to diminish because of the lower value of the dollar and the somewhat faster recovery now projected in economic activity abroad. The staff analysis suggested that, with the economy already operating close to its long-run potential, no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was likely over the forecast horizon.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the expansion continued to display considerable momentum, with business activity apparently still increasing at a pace above the economy's long-run growth potential. At the same time, indications of some slowing in aggregate demand had tended to increase over the last few months. The extent of that slowing remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially in light of somewhat disparate data on employment and spending. Nonetheless, it was generally agreed that, in the context of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, some moderation in economic growth to a pace closer to that of the economy's long-run potential was a reasonable expectation. Such a slowing seemed necessary to forestall a buildup of inflation pressures in the view of many members. A number of members emphasized that remaining margins of unemployed labor and other production resources, while difficult to assess, now appeared to be quite limited. Although views differed to some degree, the members generally concluded that the various factors affecting the course of inflation were likely to result, on balance, in little change, or perhaps a small rise, in inflation over the 1994-1995 forecast horizon. Some members regarded the risks of a significant divergence from their forecasts of economic growth and inflation as fairly evenly balanced in either direction, but most believed that those risks were tilted to the upside.  In keeping with the usual practice at meetings when the Committee considers its long-run objectives for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided specific individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1994 and 1995. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1994 as a whole was 3 to 3-1/4 percent, a little below the rate of growth estimated for the first half of the year; for 1995, the projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts centered on growth rates of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for 1994 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1995. The projections of more moderate growth in economic activity were associated with rates of unemployment in a range of 6 to 6-1/4 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1994 and 1995, about the same as the average unemployment rate in recent months. For the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent for 1994 and 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent for 1995; both ranges represented a slight increase from the average rate over the past year. Favorable developments in the food and energy sectors, which had held down overall inflation measures over the past several quarters, were not expected to continue and the drop in the dollar would be exerting upward pressures on prices in coming quarters.  Pursuant to a request from the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, the members considered extending their specific forecasts by an additional year. Many expressed reservations about the reliability and thus the usefulness of numerical forecasts extending relatively far into the future. Moreover, they were concerned about misunderstandings of specific long-range forecasts in relation to the Committee's goals and the ongoing formulation of monetary policy. The members concluded that, on balance, the Committee's policy intentions and expectations would be conveyed more effectively by the Chairman in his upcoming Congressional testimony through a discussion of the important factors bearing on trends in economic growth, prices, and unemployment; the uncertainties involved in projecting such variables; and the role of monetary policy in achieving desired economic goals. In the course of their discussion, Committee members noted that the Administration's medium-term outlook contained reasonable estimates of the trend growth in output.  In their review of developments in different parts of the country and sectors of the economy, members referred to indications of continuing growth in regional business activity ranging from relatively modest to quite robust across much of the nation; at the same time, some areas such as California continued to experience generally stagnant economic conditions. While solid growth seemed to characterize the overall economy, the members saw increasing signs of some slowing in many areas. Business and consumer sentiment generally remained quite positive, although a number of members commented on a new note of caution among some of their business contacts and some shaving of industry forecasts for the balance of the year.  Turning to the key consumer sector, members commented on various indications of some moderation in the growth of expenditures. Higher interest costs were cited by some business contacts as constraining purchases of consumer durables, but members also referred to the negative impact of persisting, highly visible cutbacks in workforces by some major business firms and of growing consumer debt. Some members also noted that supply constraints, such as limitations on the availability of some popular automobile models, had tended to curb the expansion in sales. Looking ahead, more moderate growth in consumer spending seemed likely; apart from the direct effects of higher interest rates on such spending, the prospectively less ebullient housing sector was likely to retard demands for household furnishings.  Business fixed investment was thought likely to continue to provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion, though to a diminishing extent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity and higher financing costs. While spending for equipment was likely to moderate considerably from the extraordinarily rapid increases recorded over an extended period, ongoing business efforts to improve operating efficiencies would probably sustain substantial further growth in equipment outlays. Nonresidential construction expenditures were expected to post moderate increases after stagnating earlier; in this connection, a number of members observed that commercial vacancy rates were declining in various metropolitan areas and improved demand for space was likely to generate increased construction activity. Although higher interest costs could have some restraining effect, financing for such projects was more readily available than earlier. The outlook for inventory investment remained uncertain. Some buildup in inventories was occurring, but business firms were continuing to resist sizable increases and inventory-to-sales ratios remained at unusually low levels. Developments that might be expected to foster a faster buildup, such as some lengthening of order lead times and rising pressures on capacity in some industries, had not led to the strengthening in inventory investment that had characterized comparable stages of previous business cycle expansions.  Members observed that the outlook for exports appeared to have improved and that foreign trade, on net, probably would make a small contribution to economic growth over the next several quarters. Some noted that business contacts were reporting strong foreign demand for various U.S. products. As members had noted at previous meetings, the North American Free Trade Agreement appeared to have stimulated increased trade between Mexico and the United States, although it was still too early to gauge the extent of this development. More generally, the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a somewhat greater strengthening in the economies of major trading partners than was expected earlier had enhanced the prospects for appreciable growth in U.S. exports, and in the view of at least some members that growth might prove to be considerably greater than was currently projected.  Members remarked that uncertainties about remaining margins of slack in the economy, accentuated by the change in the household employment survey, and about potential levels of economic activity over the quarters ahead made it particularly difficult to assess the outlook for inflation. However, based on what seemed to be reasonable estimates of resource utilization levels and their own projections that the rate of economic growth would slow to a pace nearer the economy's growth potential, the members generally concluded that the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, might remain about unchanged or tilt slightly higher over the forecast horizon. This conclusion took into account the effects of the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, the increase in oil prices on world markets, and the at-least-temporary rise in food prices. Some members observed that the overall behavior of prices had been somewhat more favorable than they would have predicted, given the strength of the expansion and the level of resource utilization. One explanation could be that increases in overall capacity and productivity stemming from business restructuring activities and investments in new equipment and facilities had been greater than expected. Comments from numerous business contacts around the country continued to indicate that despite the rising costs of many materials used in the production process, highly competitive markets rendered it very difficult or impossible to pass these higher costs through to prices of finished goods. At the same time, labor compensation increases had remained subdued despite indications of shortages of some types of labor in many parts of the country. Exceptions involving sizable wage increases continued to be cited for some industries, such as construction and trucking, that were operating at full capacity. Nonetheless, in the absence of an uptrend thus far in consumer price inflation and given continuing uncertainties about job prospects despite large job gains, wage pressures had remained restrained.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, most members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The economy seemed to be slowing, although to an uncertain extent. Earlier policy tightening actions were being reflected in the sluggish behavior of money and reserves, although the extent of their effects on spending were still in question. Inflation was a concern, but direct evidence of additional pressures on costs and prices was quite fragmentary. In these circumstances, all but one of the members concluded that it would be prudent for the Committee to assess further developments before taking any action. One member believed that prompt further tightening was needed to avert the development of greater inflation.  In the discussion of the near-term course of policy, the members took account of the substantial weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets over the course of recent weeks. By itself, the drop in the dollar could put some pressure on resources and prices. However, the members agreed that these effects needed to be considered in the context of overall prospects for the economy and financial markets, and policy should not be focused narrowly on the dollar alone. In any case, given the negative sentiment in the foreign exchange markets, the effects on the dollar that would flow from a small change in policy were uncertain. Ultimately, the most effective support that monetary policy could provide for the dollar was to foster the objectives of sustainable economic growth and progress toward price stability.  With regard to possible changes in policy during the intermeeting period, a majority favored a change in the intermeeting instruction in the directive from symmetry to asymmetry toward restraint. Some of the members indicated that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment to policy. Nonetheless, the risk of inflationary momentum in the expansion remained high, given an economy that appeared to be operating at or very close to full capacity, and they believed that the probable direction of the next policy move was likely to be in the direction of restraint. Some emphasized that such a move should be made promptly in response to information suggesting a greater potential for inflation. In the view of many, though not all, members the costs of policy errors were asymmetrical at this point. The costs of reversing a policy stance that turned out to be slightly too tight would be limited to somewhat slower economic growth for a time; the expansion appeared to be so well established at this juncture that the risks of a greater economic adjustment were remote. On the other hand, a policy that turned out to be unduly stimulative would foster greater inflation and inflationary expectations that probably could be reversed only at the cost of considerable disruption in financial markets and the economy. It also was noted that an asymmetric directive would underscore the Committee's determination to resist greater inflation; the asymmetry could be viewed as a logical extension of the strategy adopted in February to move to a policy stance consistent with averting inflationary pressures in a firmly established expansion.  Some members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. These members did not rule out the possible need for further policy tightening, but they believed that the risks surrounding current forecasts were about evenly weighted in both directions. One member expressed strong reservations about the use of an asymmetric directive on the grounds that such language made intermeeting changes more likely and in the view of that member markets reacted more favorably when actions were taken and announced at regular meetings. However, all those favoring a symmetric directive with an unchanged policy stance could accept an asymmetric intermeeting instruction.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second quarter, causing levels of resource utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm payroll employment have been relatively large on average in recent months; the civilian unemployment rate is reported to have declined to 6.0 percent in May. The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May, primarily because capacity constraints prevented normal seasonal increases in the production of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has slowed in recent months after very large increases in February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from winter disruptions to a pace close to the elevated fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April than in March but about unchanged from the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months, though prices of many basic industrial materials have risen.  On May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2 percent. Most market interest rates were up slightly on balance since the May meeting; declines in bond yields early in the intermeeting period were offset later by market reactions to a weakening dollar in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was down significantly further on balance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a sizable drop since early June.  M2 and M3 declined on average over May and June; for the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Blinder, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.  Votes against this action: Mr. Broaddus.  Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that additional near-term tightening was necessary to contain inflation. The tightening actions implemented thus far this year were moderate by historical standards, and he doubted that they would prove sufficient to prevent higher inflation given the strength of the economic expansion, the minimal remaining margins of unemployed labor and other producer resources, and inflationary expectations that he feared might already be rising.",199407,0,328,1994-07-31,0.06,0.24,-0.01,-0.07,0.22,0.55,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1994-07-06

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the pace of economic expansion, though still substantial, might have slowed somewhat recently. Consumer spending continued to post moderate gains, supported by rising labor income and favorable sentiment. Business outlays for plant and equipment remained on a steep uptrend, but higher interest rates seemed to be having some restraining effect on homebuilding activity. Resource utilization was at elevated levels, with factories operating at relatively high rates and labor markets evidencing very low levels of slack. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in recent months, apart from the effects of short-run swings in the volatile food and energy components.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a robust pace in July. Hiring in the services industries remained strong, with personnel supply agencies posting another sizable increase. Jobs also were up substantially in retail trade and construction. By contrast, employment in manufacturing was held down by strike activity. The civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent in July, little changed from the average for the second quarter.  Industrial production rose moderately in July after a sizable gain in June; a decline in electricity generation from its unusually high weather-related level in June damped the July advance. Manufacturing output was up considerably in July, despite a drop in the production of motor vehicles and parts; outside of motor vehicles, increases were widespread, with a very large rise recorded in the output of durable consumer goods. The overall rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing remained at a high level, with most major industry groups operating at or near capacity.  Growth in consumer spending had slowed in recent months, owing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Nominal retail sales edged lower in July after expanding at a slightly reduced pace in the second quarter. Sales at general merchandise and furniture and appliance stores increased further in July, while purchases at apparel outlets were down after large June increases. Sales at automotive dealerships fell appreciably in July after edging lower in the second quarter; these sales declines apparently resulted in part from the inability of manufacturers to produce enough of the most popular models. Housing starts in July retraced part of a large June decline but remained below their elevated rate in the fourth quarter of 1993.  Business fixed investment expanded in the second quarter at about the same brisk pace as in the first quarter but well below the rate recorded in 1993. In the second quarter, a strong recovery in nonresidential construction activity from the weather-related decline of the first quarter offset a marked slowing in business purchases of durable equipment. Much of the slowdown in the growth of outlays for equipment reflected a reduction in the pace of acquisition of office and computing equipment. Other categories of durable equipment, with the exception of aircraft and motor vehicles, continued to show solid increases. Most indicators of business investment activity suggested further large gains in coming months: Orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment, and permits for nonresidential construction had been rising as well.  Business inventory investment slowed in June after a sharp acceleration in April and May; for the second quarter as a whole, inventories were up substantially but they appeared to have remained broadly in line with sales. In manufacturing, recent inventory buildups had been concentrated in a few industries where orders had been particularly strong. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of stocks to shipments declined from an already low level. At the wholesale level, the accumulation of inventories in the second quarter was largely in durable goods, which were in strong demand; the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained below the range that has prevailed in recent years. A large part of the buildup of retail inventories in the second quarter was in nondurable goods, especially in stocks of general merchandise. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio at the end of June was near the high end of the range observed in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened slightly in May; for April and May combined, the deficit was significantly larger than in the first quarter. Exports of goods and services were about the same in May as in April, with increased shipments of machinery and industrial supplies offset by reduced exports of aircraft and gold. Imports of goods and services were slightly higher in May than in April. Most of the increase was in imports of oil, as a consequence of higher prices, and consumer goods. The economies of all the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand in the second quarter. Growth remained at a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada and appeared to have firmed in continental Europe. In Japan, growth apparently slowed somewhat in the second quarter.  Trends in broad measures of prices and labor costs had shown no change thus far in 1994. In July, the overall index of consumer prices rose at the same pace as in June, despite larger monthly increases in the food and energy components of the index. The jump in energy prices reflected the effects of the earlier run-up in crude oil prices. For the twelve months ended in July, both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy rose by about the same amounts as during the preceding twelve-month period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods were up significantly in July after no change in June; large price increases were recorded for coffee and finished energy goods. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on balance over June and July and registered only a small rise over the twelve months ended in July. At an earlier stage of processing, producer prices of intermediate materials posted another sizable gain in July. These prices had increased at a faster rate thus far this year than in 1993, mirroring a similar pattern in prices of nonfood, non-energy crude materials. The employment cost index for private industry workers rose more rapidly in the second quarter after a sharp slowing in the first quarter, with the acceleration in compensation largely reflecting a pickup in wage and salary growth. The increase in total compensation over the last four quarters was little changed from the advance over the previous four-quarter period.  At its meeting on July 5-6, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing rose over the period in accommodation of the usual summer pickup in demands for seasonal credit and averaged near anticipated levels. The federal funds rate remained close to 4-1/4 percent.  Other market interest rates were unchanged to up slightly on balance over the intermeeting period. Rates generally edged lower during the early part of the period as incoming data were viewed by market participants as being consistent with continued moderation in final demands and a reduced need for any further monetary tightening actions. In early August, however, interest rates began to erase their previous declines, partly in response to the strong employment report, which generated expectations that monetary policy might need to be tightened substantially in the near term. Most major indexes of equity prices were up on balance over the intermeeting period, with second-quarter corporate profits generally better than had been expected.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined early in the intermeeting period but later recouped its losses and ended the period unchanged on balance. The fluctuations in the dollar partly reflected evolving perceptions of the degree to which U.S. authorities were concerned about further weakness in the currency. Over the intermeeting period, the dollar depreciated slightly against the mark but edged higher against the yen.  Both M2 and M3 expanded in July after declining on average over May and June. The growth of M2 in July owed in part to a sizable increase in liquid deposits, but in light of a resumption of run-offs at bond mutual funds it also may have reflected a renewed preference by households for the protection of principal provided by money market mutual funds. The strength in M2 showed through to M3, which also was boosted by funds garnered from wholesale sources to finance a surge in bank credit. For the year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate pace.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy was operating close to its long-run capacity and that growth would trend lower over the next several quarters to a rate generally in line with the increase in its potential. Under these circumstances, trends in the core rate of inflation would not deviate significantly from recent experience, but there was a risk that such an outcome might require further monetary policy tightening. Growth in consumer spending was projected to slow in response to smaller gains in employment and income, some reductions in pent-up demands, and the adverse effects on household financial wealth of earlier increases in interest rates and declines in stock market prices. Business fixed investment, while remaining relatively brisk, was expected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast horizon, primarily owing to smaller projected gains in sales, a growing shortfall of corporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs. Single-family housing construction would continue to be damped by the higher mortgage rates; however, the pace of homebuilding was expected to remain relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years, reflecting still unsatisfied demand for homeownership and the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing, as judged by the standards of the past two decades. The restraint on economic activity exerted by weak export demand was projected to diminish as economic conditions improved abroad, given the competitiveness of U.S. produced goods.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that final aggregate demand appeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months but that the expansion still seemed to have considerable underlying momentum. Indeed, available data on the various components of spending taken together might in fact be understating the growth in economic activity; the strength of labor markets and measures of gross domestic income suggested a somewhat stronger economic performance. Sustained expansion, perhaps at a pace broadly in line with or a bit above the economy's long-run growth potential, remained a reasonable expectation, but many members observed that they saw the risks as being on the upside of such a projection in the absence of some further policy tightening. Views varied to some degree with regard to available margins of unemployed resources, but the members agreed that the economy probably was operating very close to, and in the view of some might have reached, its long-run potential. In these circumstances, the members saw appreciable risks of intensifying pressures on resources and higher inflation. Broad measures of wages and prices suggested little change in inflation trends in recent quarters, but worrisome signs of greater inflation were evident in the prices of materials purchased by business firms and in anecdotal reports of successful efforts by an increasing number of businesses to pass on rising costs by raising prices.  In their comments on business conditions in different parts of the nation, members reported continuing expansion ranging from modest to solid growth in most regions, However, the rise in business activity appeared to have slowed in some areas and business conditions had remained essentially unchanged in a number of others, notably in California. In the course of their review, members pointed to the general strength in labor markets as evidenced, for example, by statistical indications of large and persisting gains in employment and relatively low initial claims for unemployment compensation. These data for the national economy were reinforced by reports of sizable employment increases in numerous industries and parts of the country and associated indications of growing labor shortages in a number of areas and some occupations.  The financial climate remained supportive of sustained economic growth. It was clear that the rise in interest rates since the start of the year had had some restraining effects on interest-sensitive expenditures, notably housing and perhaps to a lesser extent some consumer durables, but to date these effects had not been large. Moreover, surveys and anecdotal reports suggested that banking institutions were becoming increasingly aggressive in their efforts to foster loan growth by easing many terms and standards for lending. In financial markets more generally, risk spreads had remained relatively narrow and both debt and equity markets appeared to be well positioned to provide ample financing for further economic expansion.  In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members saw widespread evidence of a well established expansion. Some signs of moderation from the rapid advance in recent quarters had emerged, including statistical and anecdotal indications of somewhat slower growth of consumer spending. Members noted, however, that an apparently significant portion of the recent weakness in sales of motor vehicles appeared to be related to supply shortages that were in the process of being corrected. Consumer confidence remained at a high level and likely reflected, among other factors, the strength in job markets in many parts of the country. Nonetheless, more moderate consumer spending was a reasonable expectation in the context of a low saving rate, increased consumer debt levels, and higher interest rates. One member commented that some pause in the expansion of overall consumer spending would not be unusual after several quarters of robust growth, and another remarked that the rise in household expenditures had been larger than the increase in household cash incomes by an appreciable margin over the past year.  Further marked expansion in business-fixed investment was likely to make a sizable contribution to continuing economic growth. Ongoing strength in orders, including foreign demand, pointed to rapid further growth in expenditures for business equipment over coming months. Some moderation in the growth of such spending appeared likely later in the context of projected slower expansion in sales and the rise in financing costs. The outlook for nonresidential construction, while not ebullient, nonetheless seemed likely to become a more positive factor in fostering further economic growth. Demand for commercial real estate space, including office space, had begun to improve in many areas. Against this background and given the apparent availability of financing for soundly based projects, nonresidential construction activity, while displaying considerable local variation, appeared to be on a moderate uptrend for the nation as a whole.  Prospective developments in foreign trade also were expected to have a positive effect on the expansion of the domestic economy and indeed to offset some of the anticipated slowing in the overall growth of domestic demand. Economic conditions abroad were improving faster than had been anticipated, and this development along with the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was projected to stimulate faster growth in exports while curbing that of imports over the next several quarters.  Members focused on recent inventory developments, which in the context of some moderation in the growth of final demand had accounted for a considerable portion of the overall expansion in GDP reported for the second quarter. While the rate of inventory accumulation could be expected to slow in the current quarter, the extent of that slowing and its retarding effects on near-term economic growth were uncertain. Partly on the basis of anecdotal reports, the members concluded that much of the inventory buildup in the second quarter was voluntary, thereby reducing the probability of a sharp reversal. Indeed, to the degree that delivery lead times might edge up in various industries as capacity constraints were encountered, stronger efforts to build inventories could emerge, especially against the background of currently low inventory-to-sales ratios. Some business contacts reported that they were planning to add to their inventories over the months ahead. At the same time, ongoing business efforts to maintain relatively lean inventories undoubtedly would tend to limit any broad buildup in inventories.  With regard to the outlook for residential construction, members reported some slowing in single-family housing demand in many parts of the country as homebuyers reacted to the rise in mortgage interest rates. However, single-family homebuilding activity was being maintained at relatively robust levels in some areas and multifamily housing construction was improving in numerous local markets. On balance, the housing sector probably would contribute little, if any, impetus to the expansion but homebuilding was likely to remain well above its earlier depressed levels.  In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, many members focused on the prospects for further growth in output in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed production resources. It was difficult to assess the extent of remaining margins of available resources, in part because of uncertainty about the effects on capacity of ongoing efforts to improve productivity through business restructurings and sharp increases in business investment expenditures. Despite somewhat differing views, the members generally concluded that the economy probably was operating at a level that was quite close to, if not already at, its long-run potential. In the circumstances, many of the members commented that the risks of intensifying inflation clearly were on the upside if the economic expansion did not moderate from its pace in recent quarters. Indications of accelerating cost and price pressures were not yet visible in broad measures of inflation and wages. Those measures, while subject to fluctuations largely associated with swings in food and energy prices, had not displayed any discernible trend over the past several quarters. At the same time, signs of increasing prices and costs at earlier stages of production appeared to be multiplying, including sizable price increases for a wide range of industrial commodities. More generally, members cited a growing number of reports by business firms of rising input costs and of more successful efforts by some firms to raise prices. It also was noted that the decline in the value of the dollar would contribute, directly and indirectly, to some upward pressures on prices. However, business contacts, notably at the retail level, indicated that competition remained intense and made it very difficult to pass on cost increases through higher prices, thereby placing a premium on continued efforts to contain costs through improvements in productivity. From a differing perspective, one member noted that decelerating growth in money measures such as Ml, the monetary base, and reserves--which had been expanding rapidly for several years--implied that monetary policy had been moved substantially to curtail any increase in inflation pressures, though more action might still be required.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members agreed that a prompt further tightening move was needed to provide greater assurance that inflationary pressures in the economy would remain subdued. The members recognized that the Committee's earlier policy actions were exerting some restraining effects and that further lagged effects from those actions could be expected. Even so, the underlying strength in demand and narrow margins of slack in the economy pointed to a considerable risk of further inflation pressures in the absence of additional policy tightening.  With regard to the size of the policy adjustment, the members were apprised of a disposition on the part of the Board of Governors to approve the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that was pending at several Federal Reserve Banks. The Committee members endorsed a proposal to allow the effects of such a rise in the discount rate, should it be approved, to be reflected fully in reserve markets. Consideration was given to a lesser adjustment in reserve conditions, but the members concluded that a smaller step was unlikely to be adequate, and on perceiving this, financial markets would quickly build in further monetary tightening, the unknown size and timing of which would add to market uncertainty and volatility. A more decisive policy move might reduce the need for further tightening later, or possibly even avert that need entirely, by moderating or arresting the inflationary momentum in the economy more promptly and by helping to curb inflationary expectations more effectively.  In considering possible adjustments to policy during the period before the next meeting, all the members favored moving to a symmetric intermeeting instruction. Such a directive would be consistent with the members' expectations that a further policy action was not likely to be needed for some time, given the substantial nature of today's policy move. However, a symmetrical directive would not rule out the possibility of a policy move in the event that intermeeting developments differed substantially from expectations.  At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all the members indicated they could support a directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate, and that did not include a presumption about possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of economic expansion, though still substantial, may have moderated somewhat recently, while resource utilization has remained at high levels. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a robust pace in July, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent--about the same as the average for the second quarter. Industrial production rose appreciably over June and July. Growth in consumer spending has slowed in recent months, owing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been rising as well. Business inventories registered a large increase in the second quarter, but inventories appeared to have remained broadly in line with sales. The average nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April and May than the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months, apart from the effect of short-run swings in volatile food and energy components.  Most market interest rates are unchanged to up slightly on balance since the July meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was unchanged on balance over the inter-meeting period.  M2 and M3 turned up in July following declines on average in both aggregates over May and June; for the year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the pace of economic expansion remained substantial, though it appeared to have moderated slightly in recent months. Final sales, especially of consumer goods, had firmed during the summer months while inventory investment apparently had slowed after a second-quarter surge. Manufacturing activity, bolstered by a pickup in production of motor vehicles, had been rising briskly, and the trend of payroll hiring remained strong. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had been somewhat larger in recent months, and prices of materials had remained under considerable upward pressure.  Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August, though at a somewhat less rapid rate than the average pace in earlier months of the year. The slowdown in hiring in August was concentrated in retail trade, where employment was little changed after large gains in the two prior months, and in construction, where it fell slightly. In manufacturing, employment was up considerably after essentially no change in July; while much of the strength was related to a pickup in the production of motor vehicles, hiring was up in a number of other industries as well. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers declined in August from July's relatively high level, but for the two months combined the average hours worked was well above the second-quarter level. Both household employment and the labor force surged in August, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent.  Industrial production rose sharply in August after sizable gains in previous months. The August advance reflected a large increase in manufacturing output that was partly offset by declines in mining production and electricity generation; much of the strength in manufacturing resulted from a large rise in the output of motor vehicles stemming from unusually rapid retooling for the new model year. Elsewhere in manufacturing, production of office and computing equipment continued to expand briskly, and output of industrial equipment was up significantly. Total utilization of industrial capacity rose further in August from already high levels.  Consumer spending remained on a solid upward trend. Retail sales rose considerably in August after holding steady in July. Sales of goods other than motor vehicles registered sizable increases in both July and August. Sales of motor vehicles, which had been constrained in recent months by shortages of popular domestic models, rebounded in August. Housing starts in July and August averaged slightly less than their second-quarter rate. Single-family starts had leveled off in recent months after declining earlier in the year; multifamily starts, though erratic from month to month, had been drifting higher.  The limited data available for the third quarter suggested that growth of real business fixed investment, though still strong, continued to slow from the very rapid pace of 1993. Shipments of nondefense capital goods declined in July, offsetting much of a large June advance. However, orders for nondefense capital goods were up significantly on balance in June and July, pointing to continued brisk expansion in business spending on durable equipment. Nonresidential construction activity increased further in July, and permits for such construction remained on a mild uptrend.  The growth in business inventories slowed markedly in July after surging in the second quarter. The July deceleration reflected a sizable reduction in retail inventories, principally automotive and general merchandise stocks. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio declined sharply in July to about the middle of the range seen in recent years. At the wholesale level, inventories increased substantially, both in July and over the second quarter, and the overall inventory-to-sales ratio edged up in July toward the middle of the range for this ratio in recent years. Inventory investment also picked up in manufacturing, where much of the July accumulation represented stocks of materials, supplies, and work-in-progress. The run-up in stocks was accompanied by a drop in factory shipments, and as a result, the inventory-shipments ratio recorded an unusually steep rise.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in July after a large increase in the second quarter. The value of exports of goods and services slipped in July from a relatively high level in June, while the value of imports in July changed little from June. Economic activity in all of the foreign G-7 industrial countries except Japan expanded rapidly in the second quarter, and available indicators suggested that strong growth continued on average in the third quarter. In Japan, activity contracted in the second quarter, reflecting weakness in consumption and business investment; the limited data available for the third quarter suggested that growth in that country might have resumed.  Consumer prices rose a little faster in July and August than their average pace for the first half of the year. The recent pickup in consumer inflation reflected large increases in energy prices as well as somewhat higher food prices; excluding the food and energy components, consumer price advances had remained moderate. Prices rose briskly at the producer level in July and August as prices of finished energy goods surged and prices of finished foods turned up after declining over the first half of the year. For items other than finished foods and energy, the increase over the July-August period was a little faster than in the first half of the year. Recent data indicated little change in wage trends. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in August at about the rate observed over the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on August 16, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise in the discount rate. The Committee did not include in the directive any presumption about further adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Immediately after the conclusion of the August meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate to a level of 4 percent. The Committee permitted the full amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in the market for reserves, and the federal funds rate rose about 1/2 percentage point to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. As indicated in an announcement released on the day of the meeting, the Committee did not anticipate that further policy tightening was likely to be needed for a time, given the substantial nature of the policy move. Accordingly, open market operations over the intermeeting period were conducted with a view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of pressure on reserve positions implemented just after the August meeting, and the federal funds rate remained near 4-3/4 percent. In accordance with the usual cresting of seasonal demands for discount credit at this time of the year, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing rose over much of the period but began to edge lower subsequently. Borrowing averaged near anticipated levels.  Most market interest rates were up somewhat on balance since the August meeting. Short-term rates, which had risen prior to the meeting in anticipation of a smaller policy move, increased modestly further after the Federal Reserve tightened and then changed little over the next several weeks. Subsequently, however, these rates began to move higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as pointing to the potential for greater inflation in the future and hence to further firming in reserve conditions. Long-term yields fell following the policy tightening, but these declines were erased within a few days, and rates later rose noticeably further in response to the incoming data. Most major indexes of equity prices were up on balance over the intermeeting period despite price declines near the end of the period.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period. Bearish sentiment toward the dollar in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be influenced importantly by continuing concerns about inflation trends in the United States compared with those in other major industrial countries.  M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding moderately in July, and data available for September pointed to little further change in either aggregate. The August decline in M2 reflected weakness in most of its liquid components that may have been induced to a considerable extent by the rise, which began early this year, in the opportunity costs of holding such accounts. The decline in M3 was associated with a sharp drop in institution-only money funds in response to the increase in market yields, but the weakness in this broader aggregate was limited by the brisk issuance of large-denomination time deposits as banks continued to rely on managed liabilities to fund credit growth. For the year through August, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the lower ends of their respective ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity would slow appreciably over the next several quarters, dropping briefly below the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. According to a staff analysis, the economy already was operating at its long-run capacity, and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained higher inflation. Growth in consumer expenditures was projected to moderate next year as spending on consumer durables lost some momentum in the context of diminishing pent-up demands, the rise in borrowing costs, and smaller gains in income. After an extended period of very rapid increases, growth in business fixed investment also was expected to slow appreciably, partly reflecting less favorable financial conditions and partly the slower pace of output growth. Homebuilding would be damped by higher financing costs, though activity in this sector was expected to remain well above the depressed levels reached in recent years. With the economy operating close to its long-run potential, no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Consumer price inflation was projected to be elevated over the near term--by some pass-through of the ongoing run-up in materials prices and by higher import prices--before settling down again.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented on continuing indications of a robust expansion in business activity, with output near maximum sustainable levels. They still viewed significant slowing in the pace of the expansion as a reasonable expectation, though they acknowledged that signs of such slowing currently were limited and in particular that the most recent data indicated a greater probability of somewhat more strength in aggregate demand than had appeared to be developing during the late spring and early summer. The policy tightening actions implemented earlier in the year seemed to have elicited only a mild response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. However, much of the retarding effects of those actions, including the recent sizable tightening in August, probably had not yet been felt in the economy. In light of the strength of aggregate demand and lags in the effects of policy, the risks of some rise in inflation rates probably had increased. How large this rise might be or when it might be reversed was very difficult to predict at this point. However, indications of a persisting pickup in inflation would be a matter of considerable concern, and further developments would need to be monitored with special care in light of the Committee's longstanding commitment to containing inflation and moving over time toward price stability to foster the maximum, sustainable performance of the economy.  In their review of developments across the nation, members commented on high levels of business activity in many regions and many of them referred to increasing reports of scarcities of specific types of labor resources. After softening earlier in many areas, business conditions appeared to have strengthened in a number of regions during recent weeks while displaying little change or continued moderate growth elsewhere. Robust expansion in manufacturing activity, especially in the motor vehicle and related industries, was a notable feature of recent business developments. On the financial side, the overall expansion of credit had remained moderate, but many members stressed the ready availability of financing from increasingly aggressive bank lenders. Moreover, despite higher interest rates, capital markets were providing continued support to a wide variety of borrowers. The constraints on the availability of credit and the reluctance of many borrowers to incur new debt, factors that had tended to retard the recovery during its earlier stages, had given way to a financial climate that might even be providing an extra impetus to spending.  With regard to the outlook for activity in key sectors of the economy, consumer spending had been more buoyant than expected over recent months and members saw such spending as likely to be reasonably well maintained. Some moderation in its growth over the quarters ahead seemed likely, however, as pent-up demands increasingly were satisfied and housing-related purchases of consumer durables tended to moderate. Members cited anecdotal evidence of fairly brisk retail sales in many areas recently and associated optimism among retail business contacts. Recent survey results indicated that consumer sentiment remained favorable. Sales of motor vehicles were expected to continue the improvement noted in August as supply shortages were met through increased production.  Business fixed investment was viewed as likely to rise substantially further over the next several quarters, but the rate of growth had been moderating this year and probably would diminish further in conjunction with the projected slowing in overall demand. The expansion in expenditures for business equipment had slowed considerably this year from an extremely rapid rate in 1993 and could be expected to moderate somewhat further. At the same time, nonresidential construction was slowly trending higher as firms facing capacity constraints sought to expand their production facilities.  The prospects for inventory investment remained a key uncertainty in the outlook in that developments in this sector could well have an important bearing on the extent of the anticipated slowing in the expansion of overall economic activity over the next few quarters. The surge in inventory investment in the second quarter clearly was unsustainable, but some members questioned whether the expected cutback in inventory accumulation would be sizable over the near term. Continuing strength in new orders and anecdotal reports did not point to a desire to reduce inventories and suggested that much of the second-quarter buildup probably had been intended. Indeed, in the context of increasing backlogs and lagging deliveries that pointed to growing capacity constraints, many business firms might seek to build ""safety stocks"" to avoid supply disruptions that would interfere with production schedules. At the same time, the trend toward ""just in time"" inventory management--even if temporarily arrested as safety stocks were increased--would help to limit a potentially excessive buildup in inventories that would present a threat later to the sustainability of the expansion.  Members cited anecdotal evidence tending to support statistical indications of some weakening in housing markets and they generally anticipated that the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates would exert a further damping effect on housing activity over the year ahead. However, against the background of the still relatively favorable affordability of housing and the likelihood of some further pent-up demand, only a moderate drop in overall homebuilding activity seemed likely.  A number of members expressed the view that the external sector was likely to contribute to the expansion of domestic economic activity in light of the depreciation in the value of the dollar and indications of stronger economic growth in foreign industrial nations. However, relatively rapid expansion in foreign economic activity would add to pressures on world commodity prices at least for a time. One member expressed concern about the potential, albeit uncertain, effects on the exchange value of the dollar of developments unrelated to the conduct of monetary policy, such as the ongoing trade negotiations with Japan and forthcoming elections in Germany.  In their discussion of various factors bearing on the outlook for inflation, members noted that some measures of inflation had picked up recently and that many private forecasters anticipated higher inflation in 1995 than in 1994. The worsening of inflation could perhaps be viewed as reflecting increasing capacity constraints in the face of recent growth in overall demand at a pace above the economy's long-run potential. From this perspective, the future path of inflation would depend importantly on the extent to which the expansion in overall activity would in fact abate from an unsustainable pace. Some members expressed particular concern that if above-trend growth did not moderate soon, existing inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations would quickly become more pronounced and inflation would gather momentum. Thus far, however, price pressures remained concentrated in the early stages of production. As evidenced by broad measures of prices and anecdotal information obtained from numerous business contacts, the pass-through of the higher costs of materials to the prices of final goods had been muted in what business executives continued to describe as highly competitive markets. The ability of business firms to hold down price increases in turn reflected to a marked degree their successful efforts to control unit costs through ongoing gains in productivity. Moreover, with profit margins currently at high levels, business firms facing competitive market conditions had some leeway to absorb rising costs. Increasingly tight labor markets in many parts of the country had not resulted in higher overall wage inflation, but members reported some upward pressure on the wages of certain categories of workers in strong demand. One member expressed the view that continued moderation in price and wage increases also might reflect in some measure a shift in price and wage-setting behavior attributable to the credibility of the Committee's anti-inflationary stance in recent years. A number of members commented that the sluggish to moderate growth of a wide variety of money and credit measures provided some assurance that, to date, monetary policy had not laid the basis for a sustained upturn in inflation. Nonetheless, the members concluded that the potential for additional inflation remained substantial and, from a monetary policy standpoint, rendered especially urgent the ongoing assessment of inflation trends.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the period ahead, most of the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining a steady policy course, at least for the near term. In light of the appreciable tightening of policy approved in August, the members had anticipated that no further policy change was likely to be required for a period, and at this juncture they generally continued to feel that the recent evidence did not warrant an immediate further tightening. Even so, the ongoing inflow of information on the performance of the economy continued to indicate a significant potential for higher inflation down the road, and for many members this suggested that additional monetary restraint could well be needed at some time. A key uncertainty in this regard related to the restraining effects of the policy moves implemented earlier this year; these actions appeared to have exerted less restraint to date than had been anticipated, but appreciable lagged effects from those actions--indeed, perhaps a large part of those effects--could still be expected. At this time, it was extremely difficult to evaluate whether the earlier tightening moves were exerting a lesser effect than usual or it simply was more delayed, or whether the members might have misjudged the underlying strength of the expansion. In the view of many members, the information that would become available during the intermeeting period should provide a firmer basis for judging the course of the economy and the risks of greater inflation. Should incoming information point to a greater likelihood that price pressures would intensify, the Committee would need to act promptly and forcefully to avert an upward ratcheting of inflationary expectations and actual inflation that would be difficult to reverse. Consequently, while views differed with regard to the likely need for some policy tightening over the weeks immediately ahead, the members generally supported a shift from the symmetry in the August directive to asymmetry toward restraint. Some members indicated that they could accept an asymmetric directive, but they expressed misgivings about the use of such an instruction in the directive because they felt it was subject to misunderstanding in financial markets and could add to uncertainty about Committee intentions. One member favored an immediate move to somewhat greater reserve restraint because the available evidence in his view already suggested an upturn in inflationary expectations and the prospect of a significant rise in inflation.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of members commented that the behavior of the monetary and credit aggregates should be taken into account in the evaluation of the current stance of monetary policy. While various money and related measures had for many years proved unreliable to a greater or lesser extent in gauging economic prospects, the weak growth in a wide array of these measures could not be entirely disregarded as a possible indicator of the degree of monetary restraint and argued for caution in implementing any further policy tightening. One member noted, however, that the slow growth in the narrow measures of reserves and money followed an extended period of rapid expansion and their recent weakness might not be indicative of constrained liquidity at this point. Moreover, the ready availability of bank credit and the receptivity of financial markets more generally argued that many borrowers, including small and medium-size businesses, currently had access to ample financing.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the balance of the year.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of economic expansion, though perhaps moderating slightly in recent months, remains substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent. Reflecting strength in motor vehicles, industrial production rose sharply in August after posting sizable gains in other recent months, and capacity utilization moved up further from already high levels. Retail sales were up considerably in August, boosted by a rebound in sales of durable goods, including motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in August but were unchanged from their second-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction remain on a mild uptrend. Inventory accumulation appears to have moderated recently after surging in the second quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in July from its second-quarter average. Prices of materials have remained under upward pressure, and increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have been somewhat larger in recent months.  On August 16, 1994, the Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 4 percent, and the Committee agreed that this increase would be allowed to show through completely to interest rates in reserve markets. Most market interest rates are up somewhat on balance since the August meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding moderately in July; for the year through August, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Blinder, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and Yellen.  Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.  Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a prompt move to somewhat greater monetary restraint was needed at this point. In his view, the current stance of monetary policy was overly accommodative in light of the signs of increasing price pressures and rising inflationary expectations that were associated with the continuing strength of the economic expansion and high levels of capacity utilization. In this situation, a delay in implementing some monetary policy tightening would incur a substantial risk of a further increase in inflationary expectations and could make it more costly to achieve the Committee's longer-term anti-inflationary goals.",199409,0,330,1994-09-30,0.14,0.31,0.03,-0.1,0.37,0.55,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1994-09-27

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of the economy remained substantial. Consumer spending was robust, business fixed investment continued on a strong upward trend, and housing activity had been well sustained despite the increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year. Business inventory investment had been brisk since the spring, apparently in response to the strong growth in final sales. Further sizable gains had been recorded in industrial production and employment. Increases in labor compensation were still moderate, although there were some tentative signs of wage acceleration associated with the further tightening of labor markets. Prices of many materials continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes did not indicate a pickup in consumer inflation.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in October, with job gains widespread by industry. In the service-producing sector, retail trade posted a particularly large advance while health and business services continued to record moderate increases. Manufacturing employment was up in October after having been unchanged in September; the rise was related partly to continued job growth in automobile-and construction-related industries, but payrolls also expanded in a number of other industries, including textiles, paper, rubber, and plastics. Construction hiring slowed after a large rise in September. Employment, as measured by the household survey, increased by more than the labor force in October, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent.  Industrial production increased substantially in October after having posted appreciable advances on balance in previous months. Manufacturing output accounted for all of the October rise as production declined again in the mining and utilities components. In manufacturing, the pace of motor vehicle assemblies was unchanged, but production in automotive-related industries was stepped up noticeably and output of business equipment continued to expand vigorously. Total utilization of industrial capacity climbed further in October from already elevated rates.  Consumer confidence remained at a high level, and retail sales continued to rise rapidly in October. Automotive dealers reported a large increase in sales, but strength also was evident elsewhere: Furniture and appliance stores posted another appreciable gain; apparel outlets registered a brisk rise; and spending at food and general merchandise stores grew moderately. Housing starts rose appreciably in September, reaching their highest level of the year. Sales of new and existing homes were stronger in September, despite the higher interest rates on both fixed-and adjustable-rate mortgages that had prevailed since earlier in the year.  Business capital spending remained on a solid uptrend. Shipments of nondefense capital goods were brisk during the third quarter, and with orders continuing to exceed shipments, already large backlogs increased further for most types of business equipment. Spending for transportation equipment grew at a healthy rate in the third quarter; purchases of heavy trucks persisted at a very high level, and spending for motor vehicles picked up after a second-quarter lull. Nonresidential construction activity advanced at a reduced pace in the third quarter; however, permits for new construction continued to trend higher.  Business inventory investment apparently continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter, with much of the accumulation occurring in types of goods where sales were strong. Manufacturing stocks fell in September, but for the third quarter as a whole they increased at the same moderate rate as in the second quarter; the inventory-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing in September remained near the historical low reached the previous month. At the wholesale level, inventory accumulation slowed slightly in the third quarter, and the inventory-to-sales ratio was in the lower end of its range over recent years. Retail inventories surged in August (latest data available) after having declined slightly in July. Nonetheless, the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of its range in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was substantially larger than its second-quarter average. The value of exports of goods and services rebounded in August, with increases spread widely among automotive products, aircraft, agricultural products, machinery, and consumer goods. The value of imports also increased in August, but by a lesser amount than that of exports; much of the rise reflected greater imports of automotive vehicles from Canada. Economic activity continued to expand in the major foreign industrial countries in the third quarter, but growth apparently was at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year.  Consumer price inflation remained moderate in September. For items other than the food and energy components, the increase in consumer prices over the twelve months ending in September was slightly smaller than the rise over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, prices of finished goods declined, largely reflecting a sharp fall in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding food and energy items, producer prices edged up in September and had risen slowly over the twelve months ending in September. At intermediate stages of processing, prices of many materials, notably industrial materials, had continued to move up rapidly. Total compensation of private industry workers rose significantly less over the four quarters ending in September than over the previous four quarters, primarily reflecting a sharply smaller increase in benefit costs. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers recorded a large gain in September after having expanded moderately over previous months.  At its meeting on September 27, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but included a bias toward possible firming during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the year.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. As the need for seasonal credit waned over the period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing declined substantially, with actual borrowing remaining close to anticipated levels. Apart from some tightness in reserves markets around the end of the third quarter, the federal funds rate averaged close to 4-3/4 percent.  Most market interest rates rose appreciably over the period since the September 27 meeting in response to incoming economic data that generally indicated sustained momentum in final sales and inventory investment and high levels of aggregate output relative to the economy's potential. The strong economic data and persisting upward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production appeared to heighten concerns among market participants about inflationary pressures and prospects for even more monetary tightening than had previously been anticipated. Most major indexes of equity prices were little changed on balance over the intermeeting period.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies changed little on net over the intermeeting period. The dollar trended lower over much of the period, apparently reflecting market perceptions that inflation risks in the United States were on the rise. In early November, after reaching a new post-World War II low against the yen and a two-year low against the mark, the dollar began to recover. The rebound in the value of the dollar apparently was in part a response to U.S. intervention in support of the dollar and heightened expectations of further monetary tightening in the United States.  M2 continued to edge lower in October; the weakness was concentrated in its more-liquid deposit components, for which opportunity costs had risen very substantially this year. M3 expanded at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in large-denomination time deposits issued to finance rapid loan growth and to counter runoffs of nondeposit sources of funds. For the year through October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity would slow markedly over the next several quarters and for a period would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating at or beyond its long-run capacity, and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained higher inflation. The expansion of consumer spending was projected to slow considerably in response to diminishing pent-up demands, higher borrowing costs, and reduced income growth. Business fixed investment also was anticipated to decelerate appreciably in the context of smaller increases in sales and less favorable financial conditions. Homebuilding was expected to be damped by higher financing costs, although housing activity likely would remain well above the depressed levels of recent years when cash-flow affordability had been less favorable. The lower value of the dollar and the favorable prospects for faster economic recovery abroad were projected to bolster the demand for U.S. exports. With the economy having reached or exceeded its long-run potential in the staff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources eased.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on widespread statistical and anecdotal indications of considerably greater strength in the business expansion than they had anticipated earlier, with numerous industries now operating at or beyond historic, long-run capacity levels. They saw few signs that growth in aggregate demand might be moderating toward a more sustainable pace; nonetheless, they continued to view some slowing as a reasonable expectation as the monetary policy tightening actions implemented earlier exerted their lagged effects on interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. At this point, increases in prices of final goods and services and in wages generally did not appear to be trending higher, but the members were concerned that inflation would worsen as the effects of continuing strong demand, rising production costs, and higher import prices increasingly were felt in an environment where the utilization of labor and other producer resources was already at, if not above, sustainable full employment levels.  The evidence of persisting growth in aggregate demand at a pace appreciably above that of the economy's long-run potential and of developing pressures on resources tended to be confirmed by anecdotal reports of robust business expansion in many parts of the country and growing difficulties in hiring and retaining some types of labor. Ongoing cutbacks in some industries, such as defense, were tending to hold down overall economic activity in a few regions, but all parts of the country appeared to be experiencing at least modest economic growth, including California where economic activity now seemed to have turned up after an extended period of weakness. Sentiment among retailers and other business contacts was widely reported to be quite favorable. In addition, some members commented that despite higher interest rates financial conditions generally remained conducive to further business expansion. The lending constraints that had tended to retard the expansion earlier seemed to have given way to increasingly accommodative loan policies by depository institutions and ready access to market sources of financing for many business firms.  In their assessment of the contribution of key sectors of the economy to the expansion, members commented on the current strength of consumer spending and also noted that business contacts were expressing considerable optimism about the prospects for retail sales over the holiday season. Consumer sentiment, as evidenced by survey results and retailer comments, appeared to be at a high level. Some moderation in the growth of consumer spending could be expected to emerge next year for a variety of reasons, including reduced pent-up demands and some anticipated slowing in the growth of employment and consumer incomes. Members also noted that rising interest rates were likely to damp consumer spending, notably for durable goods, though there was little evidence of such a development thus far. A projected softening in housing markets would contribute to slower growth in demand for housing-related consumer durables.  Expanding sales and favorable profit margins were fostering strong growth in business fixed investment, and much of the momentum in this sector probably would carry over into 1995. Some business contacts reported that they were developing plans for major capital outlays over coming months. As the year progressed, however, the increases that had occurred in interest rates, and the possibility of less receptive financial conditions more generally, should begin to exert some inhibiting effects on business fixed investment, especially if profit margins also were to fall in the context of rising labor and other costs.  With regard to the outlook for housing, members reported that conditions were somewhat uneven across the country but that for the nation as a whole rising mortgage rates had had surprisingly little effect thus far on this typically interest-sensitive sector of the economy. One reason, it was suggested, was the apparent willingness of some homebuyers to accept higher mortgage rates at this point because they expected rates to rise further later. Even so, the members continued to anticipate some slowdown in housing construction over coming quarters. Overall construction activity was likely to be supported to some extent, however, by further gradual gains in nonresidential construction, notably commercial and industrial structures, and perhaps some continuing strength in multifamily housing.  After a surge in the second quarter, inventory investment remained substantial in the third quarter and appeared to be continuing at a robust pace in the current quarter. For a variety of reasons, inventory accumulation might well be relatively brisk for some period of time, given the favorable sales experience of numerous business firms and the still quite low levels of inventories relative to sales. Moreover, with capacity pressures in many industries leading to some lengthening in delivery times, businesses would tend to build inventories to support sales and avoid disruptions to production schedules. Tending to confirm such an assessment were anecdotal reports suggesting that recent additions to inventories were largely intended and not the result of disappointing sales. An inventory buildup at the pace recorded on average in the second and third quarters would not be sustainable, but inventory investment was likely to be relatively well maintained over coming months if aggregate demand were to expand in line with current expectations.  The members generally anticipated that the external sector of the economy would provide some impetus to the expansion. The recent depreciation of the dollar and strength in foreign economic activity could be expected to boost real exports at a time when growth in real imports was likely to moderate. The resulting improvement in the nation's net trade position would, however, tend to exacerbate any tendency for domestic demand to outrun the economy's output potential.  In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for prices, the members saw considerable potential for higher inflation if growth in demand and output continued at an unsustainable pace, placing added pressures on labor and other producer resources. They noted indications of greater inflation pressures, especially in the rising prices of many materials used in the production process and the increasing number of reports of labor shortages. To date, prices of finished goods and services did not reflect those pressures and overall wage inflation did not appear to be trending higher. Even so, at least some modest worsening of inflation seemed quite likely over the quarters immediately ahead, despite the persistence of strong competition that continued to limit attempts to raise prices in most markets. This view seemed to be reinforced by increasing reports of successful efforts by some business firms to establish and sustain higher prices and by numerous indications of business plans to raise prices around year-end or the early part of next year. Other factors that appeared to have adverse implications for the inflation outlook included faster increases in import prices, and in the view of at least some members the prospect of diminishing gains in productivity. Moreover, as evidenced by the comments of some business contacts and the behavior of financial markets, inflationary expectations might be in the process of worsening, though such a development could not be seen in broad survey results. To what extent such expectations would become more pervasive and foster greater inflation momentum was very difficult to gauge at this point. One member suggested that some further rise in inflation might reflect a typical development in a maturing cyclical expansion but that such a rise would not necessarily augur a permanent uptick in inflation or even that progress toward price stability would not continue to be made over time, provided appropriate monetary policies were pursued.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members agreed that the current stance of monetary policy presented unacceptable risks of embedding higher inflation in the economy. The expansion retained appreciably more forward momentum and greater inflationary potential than the members had anticipated, given the policy restraint implemented earlier this year. The reasons for that outcome remained unclear. Among the suggested explanations were that the earlier restraint appeared to have had a less-than-expected effect on current economic conditions and, in particular, on the more interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Some members also suggested that the underlying expansion was stronger than they had anticipated, and a couple referred to the possibility that the lingering effects from the accommodative policy stance maintained through last year were larger than had been expected. Moreover, additional monetary restraint seemed to be needed to counteract the stimulative effects on domestic economic activity of a number of atypical financial developments in a period of rising interest rates; these included the easing of non-price credit terms by depository institutions, the ample availability of funds in debt and equity markets, and the depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The members recognized that monetary policy actions exerted much of their effects after relatively long lags and that a substantial portion of the restraint stemming from the earlier policy actions undoubtedly had not yet been felt in the economy. They agreed, nonetheless, that monetary policy was still insufficiently restrictive in light of emerging inflationary signals in the economy. Views differed to some extent, however, regarding the degree of additional restraint that might be needed to foster the Committee's objectives for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.  A majority of the members believed that an unusually sizable firming of monetary policy was desirable at this time, and they endorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions in line with a 3/4 percentage point increase in the discount rate that a number of Federal Reserve Banks had proposed for approval by the Board of Governors. In this view, the data becoming available in recent months had suggested considerable resilience and underlying strength in economic activity and rising risks of greater inflation pressures. A somewhat aggressive tightening action would improve the prospects for curbing intensifying inflationary pressures before they gathered further momentum and would help position the economy on a sustainable growth path consistent with the economy's long-run potential. The members acknowledged the difficulty of judging the precise degree of monetary restraint that would be needed to attain the Committee's objectives and in particular the risk that further efforts to control inflation at this juncture might foster greater-than-intended weakening of the expansion. The Committee could not prejudge how much, if any, additional monetary restraint might be needed in the future. That would depend on further developments, but for most members a sizable move at this point represented the most appropriate balance among the competing risks. During this discussion, it was noted that recent developments were having an unsettling effect on financial markets, and a tightening move of this magnitude might contribute to market stability by reducing expectations of higher inflation and a further near-term policy action. Some members also commented that the action would tend to reinforce the recent intervention in the foreign exchange markets.  Other members indicated that they preferred a less forceful policy move at this point, one that would be consistent with the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that had been proposed by several Federal Reserve Banks. In their view, substantial further restraint could be expected from the combined effects of the policy tightening actions implemented earlier this year and the inevitable waning of the stimulative effects of policy actions taken in previous years. While the need for further monetary restraint could not be ruled out, a more limited policy move at this point could reasonably be expected in this view to accomplish the greater part or all of the Committee's anti-inflationary objectives over time and would minimize the risk of setting policy on an overly restrictive course with undesired consequences for the business expansion later. Moreover, a cautious approach could lessen the risk that the Committee's policy intentions would be misinterpreted, with some resulting damage to consumer and business confidence and dislocation in financial markets. Despite their reservations, these members indicated that they could accept the degree of restraint preferred by the majority because of the quite small difference in the effects of the alternative moves on the economy over time.  With regard to possible changes in policy during the period until the next meeting, a majority of the members favored associating the more substantial policy adjustment with a symmetric intermeeting instruction. This preference was based on expectations that a further policy action was not likely to be called for over the near term, although a symmetric directive would not prevent an intermeeting adjustment if near-term developments differed substantially from expectations. One member expressed the view that the unusually large move made it especially important to follow a steady policy course for some period of time and to undertake any further firming only if new information of a surprisingly strong nature were to be received. Another member indicated a preference for an asymmetric directive toward restraint because such a directive would be more consistent with the likely need in his view for further monetary restraint to contain inflationary forces in the economy.  At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all the members indicated they could support a directive that called for a significant increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate, and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the growth of the economy has remained substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in October, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent. Industrial production registered a large increase in October after posting sizable gains on average over other recent months, and capacity utilization moved up further from already high levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts rose appreciably in September. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been trending higher. Inventory accumulation appears to have continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter. For July and August combined, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened from its second-quarter average. Prices of many materials have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services have increased moderately on average over recent months.  Most market interest rates have risen appreciably since the September meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was essentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period, though it was weaker through much of the period.  M2 contracted further in October while M3 expanded at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in large-denomination time deposits. For the year through October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase significantly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested a further pickup in economic growth in recent months. Consumer spending, supported by strong expansion of employment and income and by buoyant consumer sentiment, remained robust. Business capital spending and exports were rising briskly. Payroll employment remained on a strong upward trend, and industrial output posted further substantial gains. Broad indexes of prices of consumer goods and services increased moderately on average over recent months, although prices of many industrial materials and intermediate supplies continued to move up rapidly.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November after an appreciable expansion in October. Job gains in the service-producing sector were stronger in November than in October, as a pickup in hiring in business services more than offset slower growth in health services and retail trade. Employment in manufacturing recorded another sizable advance in November, with increases widespread by industry. Hiring in construction was up considerably in November after a small gain in October. Job growth outpaced the expansion of the labor force in November, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent.  Industrial production, led by further increases in manufacturing output, registered another large gain in November. Among major market groups, production of business equipment surged and sizable increases were recorded for the output of materials and construction supplies. With the growth of production outpacing the expansion of capacity in November, the rate of utilization of total industrial capacity moved up further from an already high level.  Retail sales continued to rise rapidly in November. Sales were up solidly at most types of stores, but gains were particularly large at durable goods outlets. Consumer spending on services also had grown significantly in October (latest data), with advances widespread among categories of services. Housing starts increased appreciably in November, when construction activity apparently was boosted by favorable weather in some parts of the country. Multifamily starts rose in November to their highest level in four years, while single-family starts retraced a large part of their October decline.  Business capital spending remained on a pronounced upward trend. Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft were up slightly further in October after having advanced sharply in the two previous months; shipments of computing equipment were brisk in October, while shipments of other capital goods were little changed. With regard to transportation equipment, outlays for aircraft continued to trend lower in October, while sales of heavy trucks rose appreciably. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to continued vigorous expansion of spending on business equipment. Nonresidential construction activity advanced further in October, led by higher spending for institutional and public utility structures. The uptrend in permits suggested further advances in nonresidential construction.  Business inventory investment was relatively robust in October. Manufacturing inventories rebounded after a small decline in September; a sizable amount of the October increase occurred at firms producing computers, office machinery, and telecommunications equipment for which demand had been strong. For manufacturing as a whole, the stocks-to-shipments ratio remained near a historically low level. Wholesale inventories continued to climb at a pace in line with sales, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector stayed near the middle of its range over recent years. Retail inventory accumulation slowed substantially in October; much of the slowdown reflected a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships. With sales up sharply, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector fell in October and remained near the middle of its range over recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October from its September level and from its average rate for the third quarter. The increase in the deficit from September's level reflected a small decline in the value of exports of goods and services, which resulted primarily from reduced aircraft shipments, and a small rise in the value of imports. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand rapidly in the third quarter, and available indicators generally suggested further substantial gains in the fourth quarter.  Despite further sizable increases in the prices of many goods at the early stages of processing, inflation at the consumer level remained moderate in October and November. Energy prices were unchanged on balance over the two months, while food prices edged higher. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at a slightly slower rate over October and November than in earlier months of the year and also increased a little less over the twelve months ended in November than over the comparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were down over the October-November period, but they rose by a little larger amount for the twelve months ended in November than they had in the year-earlier period. The increase in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers over the October-November period remained in the moderate range that had prevailed for some time, although a pickup in earnings growth was evident in a few sectors, notably construction and services. Over the past twelve months, hourly earnings increased at a slightly faster pace than they had over the year-earlier period.  At its meeting on November 15, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a significant increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The Committee did not include in the directive a presumption about likely further adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  On the day of the meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 3/4 percentage point rise in the discount rate, to a level of 4-3/4 percent. The increase in the discount rate was made effective immediately and was passed through fully to interest rates in the market for reserves. Open market operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a view to maintaining the tighter policy stance implemented immediately after the meeting, and the federal funds rate remained near 5-1/2 percent. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, reflecting the usual late-autumn pattern of ebbing demand for seasonal credit, declined over the intermeeting period; actual borrowing was close to anticipated levels.  Short-term interest rates rose considerably over the period after the November meeting. These rates had increased before the meeting in anticipation of a policy tightening move, but the size of the move was larger than expected and rates firmed a little further as a result. Over the remainder of the intermeeting interval, short-term rates responded to incoming economic data, for a time rising in reaction to indications of continuing strength in economic activity and later retracing a portion of these increases in response to favorable news on inflation. Rates on private money-market instruments with very short maturities also were lifted somewhat in anticipation of the usual year-end pressures. Long-term rates declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The more favorable inflation data, together with the relatively aggressive tightening action, apparently were viewed by many market participants as indicating that monetary policy would be sufficiently firm to hold inflation in check. The revelations in early December of financial difficulties in Orange County, California and concerns about their potential spread had a disruptive effect on financial markets, notably those for municipal securities, but aside from the securities of the affected communities, the disruption generally was brief. Most major indexes of equity prices fell, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased further over the intermeeting period, with the dollar gaining about equally against the mark and the yen. The unexpected size of the monetary policy move in November, the economic news received over the period, and the growing expectation that policy would be tightened again before long all appeared to contribute to the dollar's rise.  Growth of M2 resumed in November after several months of decline. M2's expansion largely reflected sizable inflows to small time deposits and retail money market funds that in part might have been associated with accelerated outflows from bond mutual funds and reduced inflows to stock mutual funds. M3 growth slowed a little in November as some investors shifted funds from institution-only money market accounts, whose opportunity costs had widened after the November policy tightening, into direct holdings of securities. For the year through November, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and through October (latest data) this debt measure had grown at a rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity would slow markedly over the next few quarters and then would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output over the remainder of the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond its long-run noninflationary capacity, and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained higher inflation. Growth of consumer spending was expected to decline substantially in response to slower income growth, higher borrowing costs, and reductions in household net worth associated with lower asset values. Business outlays for new equipment were projected to be damped considerably by slower growth in sales, higher financing costs, and declining profits. Homebuilding also was expected to soften in response to higher financing costs, but the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing was anticipated to act as a partial offset to those increased costs. The projected robust pace of economic activity abroad was expected to bolster export demand. With the economy having exceeded its noninflationary potential in the staff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources eased.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to continuing indications of robust expansion in employment, output, and spending and to very high and rising levels of resource utilization. They saw scant evidence at this point of any moderation in the growth of overall economic activity, including little apparent response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy to earlier policy tightening actions. Several observed that much of the expansionary momentum in the economy was likely to carry into at least the early part of next year, with potential inflationary consequences, but a number also commented that appreciable slowing during the year to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace remained a reasonable expectation. It was likely that much of the restraint from the policy firming actions implemented this year had not yet been experienced; those actions had reversed an accommodative policy that had been in place through early 1994, the effects of which probably were still being felt in the latter part of 1994. The members acknowledged that the timing and extent of the slowing in the expansion were subject to considerable uncertainty. However, with the economy now operating at or even slightly above its noninflationary potential, price and wage pressures were likely to build unless the anticipated slowing occurred relatively soon. Key measures of inflation including consumer prices, wages, and producer prices of finished goods did not display any evident uptrend at this juncture, but this could reflect a delay in the adjustment of inflation to capacity constraints and possibly some greater productivity and flexibility in the economy than had been assumed.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported on regional business conditions, which continued to exhibit local variations ranging from modest expansion in some areas to robust growth in others. Reflecting widespread strength in new orders, manufacturing firms outside the defense industry typically were operating at high levels of capacity utilization, and there were numerous anecdotal reports of tightening labor markets. As they had at earlier meetings, members remarked that despite the increases that had occurred in interest rates, financial conditions remained generally supportive of vigorous economic activity. Some noted that the financial markets were displaying a great deal of resilience and in particular that they had on balance weathered fairly readily the recent financial problems of a number of local governments and private corporations that had experienced large unanticipated losses on their investments. Banking institutions remained aggressive in their efforts to extend loans to businesses and consumers.  In their comments on developments in key sectors of the economy, members noted that consumer spending had increased briskly in recent months amid indications of favorable consumer sentiment that in turn undoubtedly reflected the rapid growth in employment and income. It was still too early to form reliable estimates of retail sales in the current holiday season. The anecdotal reports pointed to seasonal increases ranging from moderate to strong in various regions, but some members emphasized that sales volumes were being buttressed by unusual promotional efforts, including relatively large discounts. Some members also commented that consumer debt was growing rapidly and that increased debt levels were likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending, especially if consumer loan rates were to be adjusted more fully upward to reflect increases in market interest rates. Rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch up with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects from losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp spending. Up to now, however, the members saw few signs of any moderation in the growth of consumer spending, including little apparent effect from somewhat higher interest rates on normally interest-sensitive spending for motor vehicles and other consumer durables.  Business fixed investment, which was contributing substantially to the current strength of the expansion, was likely to remain a positive factor in sustaining the overall growth of the economy during the year ahead. Even so, as the expansion matured and growth in final demand tended to moderate, business investment could be expected to soften. As in the case of consumer spending, however, there were few signs of any slowing in the current data or anecdotal reports. Indeed, members saw growing indications of some improvement in nonresidential construction activity as brisk economic expansion tended to absorb increasing amounts of previously vacant commercial and industrial space and prices of such facilities tended to firm. In the homebuilding sector, the latest available data did not indicate any weakening in housing construction despite the rise in mortgage interest rates. However, anecdotal reports from different parts of the country suggested that the single-family sector might be weakening. At the same time, construction of multifamily units continued to exhibit strength in a number of areas, and this sector appeared to be on a gradual uptrend as falling vacancy rates brought increases in rents. On balance, some modest softening in overall housing construction was seen as likely in response to the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates.  Inventory investment was cited as another sector of the economy that probably would exert a negative influence on economic activity over the year ahead, though inventory developments are always subject to a great deal of uncertainty. The strength of inventory investment in recent quarters reflected efforts to accommodate rapid growth in final demand and avoid disruptions to production in a period when supply delivery times were tending to lengthen. Inventory accumulation might remain elevated for a while longer, but as the projected slowing in the growth of final demand began to materialize, business firms were likely to curtail the growth of their inventories, perhaps sharply for some period, in order to maintain desired inventory-to-sales ratios.  The government sector constituted another source of considerable uncertainty in the outlook for 1995. Members referred to major fiscal policy initiatives that were likely to be considered in the new Congress, and they discussed possible short-and long-term effects on the economy. However, the shape of any legislation was still to be determined and it was not possible at this point to gauge its effects on government or private spending. On the other hand, spending by state and local governments was clearly trending higher and was likely to provide a mild impetus to the overall expansion; the financial difficulties of some local governments undoubtedly would serve to curb their spending but were not seen at this point as having any significant effect on the growth in overall expenditures by state and local governments.  With regard to the external sector of the economy, members continued to anticipate strengthening markets for U.S. exports over the year ahead. Projected growth in exports would be stimulated by the further expansion of economic activity in major U.S. trading partners and by the delayed effects of the weakening of the dollar that had occurred on balance over the course of 1994. Some members cited anecdotal indications of stronger foreign demand for agricultural and other goods produced in the United States.  Despite the evidence of vigorous expansion in overall economic activity and very high levels of resource use, broad measures of inflation in markets for finished goods and overall wage inflation had been on the low side of expectations recently. Anecdotal reports continued to point to very strong competition in most markets for final goods, and business firms continued to encounter widespread resistance in their efforts to increase prices as the costs of their raw materials and other inputs moved higher. Likewise, no uptrend currently was discernible in broad measures of wages even though labor markets were widely described as tight and labor shortages appeared to have increased further recently in some parts of the country. While examples of upward pressures on wages could be found in a number of industries, such as construction where there were pronounced shortages of skilled labor in many local areas, most business firms were strongly resisting sizable increases in their wages and were making use of ""hiring bonuses"" and ""performance bonuses"" instead of permanently higher wages to attract or retain workers. At the same time, job insecurities, including the potential loss of health and pension benefits, appeared to be holding down labor mobility and demands for higher compensation. However, many members commented that rising pressures on capacity, should they persist or intensify, could be expected to foster greater inflation at some point. Indeed, there were numerous reports of business plans to raise prices early in the new year, and a number of members commented that inflation probably would worsen somewhat over the near term. The subsequent behavior of prices and wages would depend importantly on fiscal and monetary policy developments, the extent of inflationary expectations among businesses and consumers, and the degree of pressure that further economic expansion would exert on capacity in various industries and occupations. Given their projections of some moderation in the business expansion and assuming appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, the members generally felt that any added inflation emerging in 1995 would likely be mild and could subside gradually during the year.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, a majority of the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining an unchanged policy posture at least through the beginning of 1995. Monetary policy had been tightened considerably in a series of steps starting in February, and much of the restraint stemming from those policy moves had not yet been felt in the economy. This was especially true with regard to the effects of the latest policy moves in August and November, which accounted for half the total tightening. In the circumstances, a pause seemed warranted to give the Committee more time to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the impact of previous monetary restraint. This would provide a firmer basis for gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any further monetary restraint that might be needed to contain inflation. The level of real short-term interest rates, which had risen considerably this year and were now significantly positive, the uniformly sluggish behavior of the monetary aggregates, and the recent appreciation of the dollar might indicate that policy was now better positioned to restrain incipient inflation. It was noted that the Committee might have gained some leeway to maintain an unchanged policy without adverse expectational effects in light of the relatively large policy tightening implemented just a few weeks ago and the publication of favorable price and wage data that probably had alleviated, at least temporarily, concerns about future inflation. A number of members also commented that financial markets might tend to be a bit unsettled over the balance of the year as a result of the expected year-end adjustments along with the uncertainty about the effects and incidence of the sizable market losses incurred by some investors in 1994. In these circumstances, where there did not appear to be an urgent need for a further policy move, a number of members viewed conditions in financial markets as arguing for a steady policy course pending a reassessment early next year.  A few members expressed a preference for some additional tightening of policy at this meeting. In their view, the considerable strength of the economic expansion and the high level of resource utilization argued for further monetary restraint to counter inflationary pressures; immediate action also would moderate inflationary expectations by reinforcing the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary effort. All but one of these members indicated, however, that they could accept an unchanged directive that was biased toward possible firming during the intermeeting period.  On the issue of possible adjustments to policy during the period until the next meeting, a majority of the members expressed a preference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. While most of these members preferred not to tighten policy at this point, they believed that the need for further monetary restraint was highly likely, though it would remain contingent on the tenor of the new information, including data on holiday retail sales, that would begin to arrive shortly after the turn of the year. Should the need for more restraint become apparent, it would be desirable in this view for the appropriate policy move to be made promptly to arrest any worsening of inflation and inflationary expectations, thereby minimizing the cumulative policy tightening that would be required and the ultimate cost of bringing inflation under control. The Committee always had the option of adjusting its policy during intermeeting periods even under a symmetric directive, but the balance of risks in the outlook argued in the view of these members for a policy reaction to new information that was best characterized by an asymmetric directive.  The other members who favored an unchanged policy preferred a symmetric directive. In their view, the information that would be released in the weeks immediately ahead was not likely to depart sufficiently from current expectations to warrant a policy tightening move during the intermeeting period. Moreover, current forecasts were subject to some risks in both directions. Those in the direction of appreciably greater-than-projected slowing in the expansion might have a relatively low probability, at least over the quarters immediately ahead, but that risk could not be ruled out and argued for a cautious approach to any further tightening. Accordingly, the Committee should wait until the next scheduled meeting when more information, possibly including a better assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy, would be available for evaluating the need for any further firming of monetary policy. One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to make any further short-run policy moves in the context of the Committee's long-run strategy to be considered at the next meeting. Despite their preferences, these members said that they would not dissent from an asymmetric directive.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member indicated that they could support a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a further pickup in economic growth in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent. Industrial production registered another large increase in November and capacity utilization moved up further from already high levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts increased appreciably in November. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been trending higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October from its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services have increased moderately on average over recent months.  On November 15, 1994, the Board of Governors approved an increase from 4 to 4-3/4 percent in the discount rate, and in line with the Committee's decision the increase was allowed to show through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. In the period since the November meeting, short-term interest rates have risen considerably while long-term rates have declined slightly. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies recovered further over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 resumed in November after several months of decline, while M3 expanded moderately further. For the year through November, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months and for the year-to-date it has grown at a rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and Yellen.  Vote against this action: Mr. LaWare.  Mr. LaWare dissented because he favored an immediate policy tightening action. In his opinion, the expansion remained quite strong, with high and increasing levels of utilization in labor and capital markets, and he saw a serious risk of rising inflation. In the circumstances, he also feared that a failure by the Committee to take restraining action could heighten inflationary expectations by raising concerns about the System's commitment to the objective of sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.",199412,0,333,1994-12-31,0.46,0.22,0.03,0.21,0.91,0.89,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1994-12-20

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested a strong further rise in economic activity during the closing months of 1994. Although consumer spending appeared to be less buoyant and housing demand had softened somewhat, growth in business investment, exports, and inventories remained brisk. Industrial production and payroll employment continued to record substantial gains. Broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services had risen moderately on average over recent months despite shrinking margins of unemployed resources and further sizable increases in the prices of many materials.  Nonfarm payroll employment advanced considerably further in December after a sharp rise in November. Substantial job gains were recorded in December in service industries and in the retail trade sector. Hiring in manufacturing was brisk for a third straight month, with labor demand especially strong in motor vehicles, capital goods, and electronic equipment. Construction payrolls slipped after a large increase in November. The average workweek was unchanged in December, but factory overtime edged back up, matching the highest level reached in the history of this series. The civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent.  Industrial production registered another large advance in December. Manufacturing accounted for all of the gain; an upturn in mining production offset a decline in the output of utilities associated with unseasonably warm weather. In manufacturing, the output of motor vehicles and parts surged again and further solid gains were recorded in the production of other goods. The large advance in industrial output in December boosted rates of capacity utilization above already high levels.  Retail sales were reported to have changed little over November and December after substantial advances in September and October; the flattening of sales reflected sharply reduced increases in outlays for non-auto consumer goods. Consumer spending on services rose moderately on balance over November and December, with outlays for energy services held down by unusually mild weather. Although some indicators of housing demand had weakened, housing starts posted sizable gains on balance over November and December; single-family construction remained at a relatively high level despite the rise in mortgage rates in 1994, and multifamily construction continued its gradual recovery from the depressed levels of early 1993. The regional pattern of starts activity suggested that favorable weather accounted for little of the strength in December.  Business fixed investment was estimated to have grown at a very rapid pace in the fourth quarter, with a pickup indicated for business spending on both equipment and nonresidential structures. New orders for nondefense capital goods declined on balance over November and December, but the large backlog of unfilled orders, especially for computers, pointed to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment in coming months. Nonresidential construction activity was up considerably in November for a third straight month, with increases in construction widespread by type of structure. Recent data indicated that permits for nonresidential construction were continuing to trend higher and perhaps were running ahead of construction activity.  Business inventory investment remained brisk in November; in the aggregate, the buildup was in line with shipments and sales. In manufacturing, stocks increased more rapidly in November, but the ratio of stocks to shipments declined further and was at a historically low level. In wholesale trade, inventories rose less rapidly in November, but the inventory-to-sales ratio increased further, although it remained within its range of recent years. Inventory accumulation slowed a little at the retail level, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of its range of recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat further in November, and for October and November combined the deficit was well above its average rate in the third quarter. The value of exports of goods and services increased more slowly in the October-November period than in the third quarter, largely reflecting reduced growth of exported industrial supplies. The rise in the value of imports of goods and services for the October-November period was led by increased imports of non-oil industrial supplies and automotive, capital, and consumer goods. Available data for the fourth quarter of 1994 indicated continued growth in economic activity, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace, in the major foreign industrial countries.  Consumer price inflation slowed a little in December despite a jump in food prices that was only partly offset by a decline in energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices edged up in December and rose significantly less in 1994 than in 1993. At the producer level, prices of finished goods also advanced more slowly in December, with a drop in energy prices balancing a surge in food prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy increased modestly in 1994 after being held down in 1993 by a sharp drop in the prices of tobacco products. In contrast to prices of finished goods, price inflation at earlier stages of production picked up in 1994. For intermediate goods other than food and energy items, prices rose at a faster rate in the second half of 1994, with the pickup most clearly evident in materials used in manufacturing. Prices of crude materials rose rapidly in the second half of 1994 and for the year as a whole. Increases in labor costs remained moderate. Average hourly earnings were little changed on balance over November and December, and for the year as a whole they advanced only slightly more than in 1993. More broadly, hourly compensation of private industry workers increased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in any of the previous three quarters of 1994, and the rise for the year was significantly less than in 1993.  At its meeting on December 20, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over coming months.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. With the need for seasonal credit diminishing over the period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended lower but averaged a little above anticipated levels. Near year-end, the Trading Desk accommodated heavy demands for reserves through System RPs. The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-1/2 percent during the intermeeting period.  Most other market interest rates declined slightly on balance over the period after the December 20 meeting. Very short term interest rates fell after the first of the year, reflecting the disappearance of year-end premiums. More broadly, favorable news on inflation and indications of some unexpected slowing in the growth of final demands apparently led market participants to conclude that further tightening of monetary policy, though still expected to be substantial, would be less than previously thought and would be spread over a longer period. Yields on tax-exempt instruments declined considerably as concerns about the implications of Orange County's problems for the financial condition of other municipal governments abated. Strong earning reports for the fourth quarter boosted major indexes of equity prices.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell substantially against the mark, which was buoyed by safe-haven inflows from weaker European currencies, but dropped less against the yen. One factor that weighed against the dollar was uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S. economy of the sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso and the related economic and financial problems in Mexico and other developing economies; market participants expressed some concern that the crisis might constrain U.S. monetary policy in the event of further domestic inflation pressures and that the counterpart to the large prospective reduction in the Mexican current account deficit would lie importantly in the already substantial U.S. deficit.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December, and data for the first half of January suggested a further acceleration in that month. Much of the pickup in M2 in December was due to rapid expansion in overnight repurchase agreements and overnight Eurodollars, which outweighed a further contraction of liquid accounts associated in part with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by shifting funds into market instruments. The faster growth of M3 reflected, in addition to the acceleration of its M2 component, bank use of large CDs and nondeposit sources of funds to finance relatively robust demands for credit. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at the lower end of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 in the lower half of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and for 1994 it was in the lower half of its monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity would slow substantially over the next several quarters and for some period thereafter would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. Consumer spending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be restrained later by smaller gains in real incomes, the satisfaction of pent-up demands, and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in response to higher financing costs and slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was anticipated to soften a little in response to slower growth in jobs and income as well as to the increase that had occurred in mortgage rates. Recent developments in Mexico were expected to cut into exports in the near term, but the sustained economic growth elsewhere would keep export demand on an uptrend. Although there was considerable uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook, in light of the Congressional intent to cut the federal deficit the forecast incorporated a somewhat greater degree of fiscal restraint than had been built into recent forecasts. In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there remained a substantial risk that inflation could ratchet higher absent further monetary policy actions.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members agreed that growth in economic activity could be expected to moderate considerably over the course of 1995, although inflation was likely to be higher than in 1994. They acknowledged that their current projections were subject to substantial risks. The expansion continued to display appreciable momentum and signs of slower growth were still quite limited and tentative. Even so, the members remained persuaded that the lagged effects of the policy tightening implemented over the course of 1994 would become increasingly evident in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as the year progressed. The projected moderation in the growth of final demands, which probably would be concentrated at least initially in the housing and consumer durables sectors, would undoubtedly reinforce an expected cutback in inventory investment from its unsustainable pace in recent quarters. A key uncertainty in the outlook was whether the slowing in overall economic growth would be sufficient to relieve the current pressures on labor and other producer resources, which many members saw as portending higher inflation, or, indeed, whether such pressures would intensify further. Opinions differed to some degree with regard to both the likely extent of the prospective slowing in economic growth and the outlook for inflation. However, most of the members concluded that some rise in inflation appeared probable over coming quarters, and they were concerned that this upturn would not be reversed and could be extended in the absence of further monetary restraint.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for the year 1995. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, their forecasts of the growth in real GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 3 percent, compared with a growth rate of 4 percent estimated for 1994. Most of the members also anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would be associated with little change in the unemployment rate and their projections of the rate in the fourth quarter of 1995 were centered in a narrow range around 5-1/2 percent. The high levels of resource utilization implied by these projections were viewed by most members as likely to foster somewhat greater pressure on wages and prices. Accordingly, projections of the rate of inflation, as indexed by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with rates of about 2-3/4 percent in both 1993 and 1994.  In their review of regional economic developments, members referred to widespread evidence of further growth in business activity, but a number also mentioned scattered signs of some softening in a few areas or industries. Several emphasized, however, that the anecdotal evidence did not currently point to any significant moderation in the overall growth of the economy. With regard to financial conditions, members commented that they saw little indication that policy tightening actions over the past year were constraining the availability of credit to any observable degree. Despite higher interest rates, financial conditions remained broadly supportive of further economic expansion. The performance of stock market prices and the relatively narrow quality spreads in debt markets attested to a considerable degree of confidence among investors. Members also took note of the accommodative lending policies of banking institutions. Those policies had encouraged rapid growth in consumer and business loans and evidently were contributing to the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. Some members expressed concern that a number of banks might have eased their lending standards unduly and thus assumed unwarranted risks in their loan portfolios.  In their assessment of developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to the sluggish behavior of non-auto retail sales in November and December, but they also noted that the available information on consumer spending during the first few weeks of this year was inconclusive with regard to the possible emergence of a slowing trend. Anecdotal commentary on retail sales was mixed, and evidence of some decline in January sales of motor vehicles needed to be evaluated with caution because of the introduction of a new reporting method. Consumer confidence was at a high level, but some members observed that consumer indebtedness had grown rapidly and was likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending at some point. In this regard, however, it was pointed out that rising consumer incomes had kept debt service burdens from increasing significantly thus far. On balance, the members believed that the growth in consumer spending probably would slow over the forecast horizon though such spending might be relatively well maintained for some period, given the ongoing expansion in jobs and incomes and the ready availability of financing to many consumers. In any event, the outlook for this sector of the economy, which was critical to any significant moderation in overall economic growth, was uncertain with regard to both the timing and the extent of possible slowing.  Housing construction was cited as potentially the most important demand sector of the economy that was likely to contribute to more moderate economic growth over the year ahead. As evidenced by nationwide data through the end of 1994, single-family housing starts had held up unexpectedly well despite sizable increases in home mortgage rates, but anecdotal reports from around the country had pointed to weakening demand for new homes for several months and continued to do so. Against the background of current mortgage rate levels and the rise that had occurred in home mortgage indebtedness, the members continued to anticipate softening demand for housing, at least in the single-family sector. The mild uptrend in the much smaller multifamily sector was likely to continue for some period, given low rental vacancy rates in a number of areas, and further improvement in nonresidential construction was likely to offset to some extent the overall slowing in housing construction.  In the capital goods sector, real business-fixed investment had strengthened further in the fourth quarter, and the members believed, on the basis of rising order backlogs and the strength of permits for new business construction, that considerable momentum had carried into this year. While the growth in spending for business equipment undoubtedly would moderate from its extraordinary pace over an extended period, large business profits and the still relatively low user cost of capital would tend to support appreciable further growth in such investment in the context of elevated levels of capacity utilization and ongoing efforts, induced by strong market competition, to increase productivity. Moreover, nonresidential construction was now trending higher, with particular strength evident in industrial and commercial construction.  The pace of inventory accumulation in recent quarters was viewed as unsustainable and a decline in inventory investment was seen as likely over the forecast horizon, though the precise timing and extent were impossible to predict. While slower growth in final demand might in most circumstances stimulate a relatively sharp adjustment in inventory investment, members cited factors that could mute the size of that adjustment and its effects on overall GDP. These included relatively low inventory/sales ratios across much of the economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended inventory accumulation. Moreover, because an unusually large share of the inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports, a cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller-than-usual impact on domestic production. There was no current evidence that inventory investment was slowing, and indeed recent data on business loans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory accumulation since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, as more moderate growth in final demand began to emerge, concerns about the availability of materials used in the production process or stocks needed to meet market demand should diminish, and business firms could be expected to trim their demand for inventories, perhaps aggressively for a time. Indeed, this sector of the economy might well account for much of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during the year ahead.  Fiscal policy was under active debate in the Congress, and the members viewed the outcome of that debate as very uncertain. The emergence of a moderately restrictive fiscal policy might be a reasonable assumption to incorporate in current forecasts, albeit an assumption that clearly was subject to a wide range of error. In any event, any progress toward cutting future budget deficits was likely to have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.  Developments in Mexico and their possible repercussions in other developing nations had negative implications for U.S. exports, at least over the short run. Indeed, some members cited anecdotal evidence that reduced trade with Mexico had already emerged since late 1994. Moreover, the effects of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, seemed to be disrupting trade with that nation in agricultural and other bulk goods and was likely to continue doing so over the near term. Looking beyond the months immediately ahead, the relatively robust growth projected for many industrial countries together with the lower value of the dollar should boost the nation's overall external trade balance, though probably not to the extent of providing substantial stimulus to the economy. One member observed that a number of countries throughout the world faced the potential for important changes in political conditions that could have adverse effects on their growth and trading relationships, with possible repercussions on U.S. exports.  Members commented that the strong growth in economic activity and high levels of resource utilization had fostered relatively rapid increases in the prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods used in the production process, but contrary to numerous forecasts these developments had not led thus far to a broad pickup in inflation as measured by the prices of final goods and services. This favorable development might be explained in part by lags in the inflation transmission process and perhaps to some degree by various structural changes and productivity improvements in recent years that may have raised both the level and the rate of increase of the economy's potential for sustained activity. Many members observed, however, that it would not be prudent from a monetary policy standpoint to assume that continued rapid economic growth and further pressures on producer resources would not lead to rising inflation over the quarters ahead. While competitive pressures still generally limited the extent to which business firms could pass through rising costs of raw materials and other producer inputs to the prices of final goods, the members referred to increasingly numerous examples of successful efforts to raise such prices and to apparently growing business expectations that it would be possible to implement such increases over the months ahead. On balance, the members generally were persuaded that the economy had attained levels of labor and capital utilization that implied a strong risk of rising inflation over coming quarters.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members indicated that they could support some firming in reserve conditions, though a few preferred to delay such an action pending the receipt within the next few weeks of significant new information that could help the Committee to evaluate whether and to what extent the economic expansion might be slowing. Most of the members were convinced, however, that current monetary policy should be adjusted promptly to a more clearly restrictive stance. In their view, prompt action was needed to counter inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations in an economy that already seemed to be operating at, and perhaps beyond, sustainable capacity levels and to be continuing to expand at a pace above its long-run potential. In these circumstances, a delay in tightening policy would incur an unacceptable risk of allowing further inflationary momentum to develop in the economy and would require more tightening over time than might otherwise be needed to achieve the Committee's objectives. Part of the risk involved a potential further decline in the dollar at a time when there already was considerable concern about rising pressures on prices. Some tightening of policy at this meeting was generally anticipated in markets, and a failure to take action now was likely in the view of a number of members to raise questions about the credibility of the System's anti-inflation resolve and to generate some unsettlement in financial markets, notably in the foreign exchange market where the dollar already appeared to be vulnerable to further weakness. In terms of balancing the policy risks that were involved, a prompt move would provide some insurance against what these members viewed as the principal risk in current circumstances--that of rising inflation. The risks of excessive tightening, while not completely absent, were believed to be limited in light of the apparent strength and momentum of the expansion, which many forecasters had underestimated over the past year. One member expressed the view that while monetary growth had been damped, continuing restraint on the growth of the narrow monetary aggregates was desirable to offset a previous build-up in liquidity and help assure that inflationary pressures would be contained.  Members who saw an advantage in postponing a decision to tighten policy commented that, in light of some scattered signs of a moderating expansion, it would be helpful to wait for certain key statistics that would become available within the next few weeks to judge the extent of any moderation. Data on retail sales in January might provide particular insights as to whether the softening in such sales in November and December was persisting. The favorable news on inflation in the fourth quarter had lessened concerns about an immediate inflation threat, and if the incoming information confirmed the need for further tightening, the short delay in implementing it would have only a minimal cost. In addition, an increase in monetary restraint would be likely to exacerbate the problems of Mexico and perhaps to some extent those of Canada and would have potentially adverse implications for U.S. trade with both of these key trading partners. Because the probability that incoming information would counsel against any further policy tightening was certainly less than 50 percent so that only a matter of timing was likely to be involved, these members indicated that they would join with the other members in voting to tighten policy at this meeting.  Concerning the possible need to adjust policy during the intermeeting period, the members were unanimously in favor of adopting a symmetric directive. Given a decision to implement some tightening in monetary policy at this meeting, they did not believe that there should be a presumption toward possible further tightening in this period. A number of members observed that further monetary restraint might not be needed if, in line with their expectations, the incoming evidence on the performance of the economy suggested that the expansion was moderating sufficiently for the economy to return to a growth path consistent with containing inflation pressures. In any event, the Committee's most difficult decision over the next several quarters was likely to be that of determining when further tightening was no longer desirable.  Prior to the end of the meeting, the members were apprised of a disposition on the part of the Board of Governors to approve an increase of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate that was pending at several Federal Reserve Banks. In the event that such an increase was approved by the Board, the members agreed that open market operations should be conducted so as to allow that increase to be reflected fully in reserve markets.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the implementation of this policy, account would be taken of a possible increase of 1/2 percentage in the discount rate that was under consideration by the Board of Governors. The members also agreed that the directive should not include any presumption about possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a strong further rise in economic activity during the closing months of 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment was up considerably further in December after a sharp increase in November, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent. Industrial production registered another large advance in December and capacity utilization continued to move up from already high levels. Current estimates indicate little change in retail sales over November and December, while housing starts posted sizable gains on balance over the two months. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been trending appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October-November from its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services have increased moderately on average over recent months.  Most market interest rates have declined slightly on balance since the Committee meeting on December 20, 1994. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has depreciated sharply against the dollar.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year 1994 it grew at a rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee anticipated that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had moderated considerably in early 1995. Slower growth in consumer spending, associated in part with a sharp decline in expenditures for motor vehicles, and weakness in housing purchases were factors in the moderation. Despite signs of some weakening in final demand, however, further sizable gains had been recorded in industrial production and payroll employment, and overall rates of resource utilization remained high. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had risen more rapidly on average over January and February, but wages had shown no sign of an acceleration.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over January and February, although the average monthly advance was somewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were recorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in retail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed a bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a high level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose in January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 percent.  The expansion in industrial production also moderated in January and February from the rapid pace of last year. Manufacturing production grew less rapidly, with output gains down sharply in February for consumer durable goods and construction supplies. Mining production continued to be sluggish. By contrast, the output of utilities surged during the January-February period as winter temperatures, which had been unusually warm, moved back toward normal, Capacity utilization rates, which were little changed over the first two months of the year, remained high.  Retail sales fell in February, reversing most of a sizable rise in January. The February declines in sales were widespread, with slippage evident at most types of retail outlets. Most indicators of housing activity had weakened in recent months in lagged response to the earlier rise in mortgage interest rates. Housing starts fell sharply in January and edged still lower in February; these declines more than erased the gains that had been posted on balance over the closing months of 1994. A substantial drop in sales of existing homes in January (latest data) extended the trend that had been evident for some months.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another strong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing equipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January, and demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business outlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge in January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders data of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion in business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction activity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years; however, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and January, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending deregulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance for nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in the uptrend.  Business inventory investment surged in January after a slowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in January at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994. In manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January; the stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical lows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up in January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset a reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within its range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories jumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the rise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January and remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at automotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply while elsewhere the ratio edged lower.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened sharply in January from its December level and its average rate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was due to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment factors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods and services declined substantially in January after having increased strongly in November and December. The value of imports rose considerably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter. The export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely across major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in recent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in Japan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial countries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested that in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared to be positive despite the Kobe earthquake.  Consumer price increases in January and February were a little larger than the average monthly rise in 1994. Food prices were unchanged on balance over the two-month period, while energy prices were up only slightly. Producer prices of finished goods increased in January and February at the same rate as consumer prices; producer price inflation for the two months also was higher than in 1994, with a steep rise in gasoline prices in January contributing to the pickup. Producer prices of intermediate materials surged in the first two months of this year after having accelerated sharply in the second half of 1994. Average hourly earnings of private production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in February after a substantial rise in January. For the two months combined, hourly earnings increased at about the same average monthly pace as in 1994.  At its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any further adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  On the second day of the meeting, the Board of Governors approved an increase of one-half percentage point in the discount rate, to 5-1/4 percent. The rise was made effective immediately and was passed through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Open market operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a view to maintaining the tighter policy stance adopted at the meeting and implemented immediately thereafter. The federal funds rate averaged a little less than 6 percent over the intermeeting interval, and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was a little below anticipated levels.  Financial market participants generally had expected a firming in reserve market conditions, and consequently market interest rates showed little immediate reaction. Subsequently, most market interest rates declined considerably in response to both incoming data that were seen as indicating an appreciable slowing in the pace of economic expansion and statements by Federal Reserve officials that were viewed as suggesting that the period of monetary policy tightening might be coming to a close. The largest declines in yields were concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. Stronger-than-expected earnings reports coupled with heightened prospects for sustained, moderate economic expansion and continued low inflation boosted major indexes of equity prices to record levels.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially further. The dollar's decline was particularly sharp against the Japanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows against these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest rates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and fiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar's drop. Continuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted in further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the dollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar because the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower value of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and increased exports to the United States.  M2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after sizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to some recovery in both aggregates. M2's weakness in February partly reflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its volatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase agreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to be associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by shifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3 in February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2 component increased substantially further as banks continued to rely heavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead would average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened somewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however, the recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock prices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate demand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of the dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting to offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of reserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the period ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in real incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been satisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat further in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for a time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of slower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a strong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the economies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the previous forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed over the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion did not moderate sufficiently.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members agreed that the pace of the economic expansion was moderating, though the extent of the slowdown was not yet clear. The effects of the policy tightening implemented since early 1994 seemed to be showing through in interest-sensitive sectors, and those effects were expected to be reinforced by some cutback in inventory accumulation from the unsustainable rates of previous quarters. Quarters of fairly slow growth were not unusual in a period of expansion. On the whole, however, the economy appeared to retain considerable forward momentum, with current imbalances seemingly of a relatively minor nature and in the process of being corrected. Moreover, the recent declines in long-term interest rates, if these persisted, could provide fresh support for interest-sensitive spending later in 1995 and in 1996. While opinions differed somewhat with respect to both the likely extent of the slowdown and the prognosis for inflation, the members generally agreed that the economy appeared to be on a trajectory toward a more sustainable path for economic activity. However, a number of members expressed concern that the slowdown might not be sufficient to relieve the persisting pressures on labor and capital resources, thereby portending higher inflation.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite strong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a number of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business sentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat less ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys suggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though down slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the favorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending policies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth had slowed recently after a period of unusual strength.  In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members took note of the sluggishness in consumer spending that had emerged in recent months in much of the country. To a considerable extent the recent weakness reflected a sharp reduction in spending for motor vehicles, but there also were signs in the most recent data of broader declines in spending, especially for durable goods other than automobiles. Some reduction in spending for durable goods could be expected in lagged response to the policy tightening over the past year, but a few members noted that unusual weather might have led to the temporary postponement of some discretionary purchases. In assessing the recent spending patterns, it was difficult to determine whether they represented a temporary pause or a more prolonged pullback by consumers. On balance, however, growth in consumer spending probably would slow somewhat further to a rate more in line with the expansion in jobs and incomes. Consumer spending would tend to be sustained, however, by the ready availability of consumer financing and the rise in bond and stock prices, which had strengthened household balance sheets and perhaps was helping to bolster consumer confidence.  The housing market had weakened noticeably according to incoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The decline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had persisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of the year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory of unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had prevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing demand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a mitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in housing construction was being countered by further improvement in nonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial real estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed to be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity.  Committee members anticipated that growth of business investment in plant and equipment would moderate from the extraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment would continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the forecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to increase more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and business profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on equipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with that expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that investment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in an environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity utilization, intense desires to control costs and improve competitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The desire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending for the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which remained on an uptrend.  The rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters had been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales, but with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and economic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory investment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing and extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term inventory correction process might already be under way, with firms initiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that inventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and they anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be made quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory correction and its effect on economic activity would be limited. Moreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested that many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect against shortfalls in materials needed in the production process.  The defeat of the balanced budget amendment in Congress had clouded the outlook for deficit reduction. Nonetheless, a moderately restrictive fiscal policy that would provide for some progress toward a balanced budget during the forecast period was seen as a reasonable assumption. One member observed that there was a risk of a more restrictive fiscal policy arising out of the dynamics of the current political debate. In any event, any progress toward a balanced budget might be expected to have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.  Members commented that considerable uncertainty surrounded the outlook for the external sector, but for now it seemed reasonable to forecast that this sector would make a small positive contribution, on balance, to the growth of economic activity over the forecast period. In the near term, economic developments in Mexico were leading to lower U.S. exports and higher imports; anecdotal reports suggested that the effects on trade flows and local business activity tended to be felt most strongly in states that border Mexico. However, there were signs that conditions were stabilizing in Mexico, and more generally the relatively robust growth projected for the major trading partners of the United States and the lower value of the dollar now prevailing were expected to foster improvement in the nation's trade balance.  Members noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently had slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other producer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many materials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus far there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise, the persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point fostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant rise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some measure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of heavy business investments in new capacity and more productive equipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business organization that were raising the economy's capacity for sustained, noninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that despite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in materials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in passing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the dollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some increase in inflation was likely in coming months.  In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The policy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared to be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic activity and associated demands for goods and services. But the extent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary pressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available evidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a growth path for economic activity that would be consistent with limiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced. In discussing their policy choices, several members noted the relatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of all the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current circumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were involved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and assess developments before taking any further policy action.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment to policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise in inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet inflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be more consistent with the Committee's objective of moving over time toward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward momentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown in growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary tightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this connection a few members indicated that further tightening might well be needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also would provide a clear signal of the Committee's intention to resist higher inflation.  A few members preferred a symmetric directive. These members agreed that additional policy tightening might be needed if inflation began to pick up. However, they saw an undesirably weaker economic performance as being about equally likely, and in their view this balance in the risks to the outlook called for the adoption of a symmetric directive. The Committee's determination to keep inflation under control would be appropriately conveyed, in their view, through future actions rather than through the adoption of a tilt toward restraint. However, these members indicated that they could accept an asymmetric intermeeting instruction.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they preferred or could support a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion of economic activity has moderated considerably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in January and February, but at a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the civilian unemployment rate, after rising in January, fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 percent. Advances in industrial production also moderated in January and February, and capacity utilization rates generally changed little from already high levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged over the two months. Housing starts have declined somewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during the closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a still strong expansion of spending on business equipment, but with tentative signs of some deceleration; nonresidential construction has been trending appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened sharply in January from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices increased faster on average over January and February.  On February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors approved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the discount rate, and in keeping with the Committee's decision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the increase was allowed to show through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market interest rates have declined somewhat since the Committee meeting; the largest declines have been concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was down substantially further over the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to depreciate against the dollar.  M2 and M3 weakened in February, though data for the first part of March pointed to some rebound. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has picked up a little in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee anticipated that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed considerably further and that rates of resource utilization had declined. Although business investment in equipment and structures had remained strong, overall final sales had expanded less rapidly and inventories had continued to build. Manufacturing output appeared to be down appreciably, in large measure reflecting cutbacks in motor vehicle production, and the slump in housing starts since the turn of the year was depressing construction activity. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased a little faster thus far this year, while advances in labor compensation costs had remained subdued.  Nonfarm payroll employment posted reduced gains in the first quarter and changed little in April; special factors and seasonal adjustment difficulties may have depressed reported job growth in April. Hiring in service-producing industries was down sharply from the pace in previous months, with jobs in personnel supply services falling for a second consecutive month after three years of rapid growth. Employment in manufacturing decreased further, and the number of construction jobs contracted after a sizable weather-related surge in March. Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased considerably in recent weeks, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent in April.  Industrial production fell further in April, with manufacturing registering a substantial decline. The drop in industrial output largely reflected a cutback in the production of motor vehicles and parts, but declines in output also were evident in other cyclically sensitive sectors, such as non-auto consumer durables and construction supplies. Production of business equipment other than motor vehicles registered a small gain. Total utilization of industrial capacity continued to decline in April; however, operating rates in manufacturing remained at relatively high levels.  Retail sales were down in April after having risen moderately over the first quarter; a steep drop in sales of motor vehicles accounted for all of the April decline. Total expenditures on other types of goods edged higher in April, even though sales of apparel, furniture, and home appliances were noticeably weaker. Housing starts changed little in April after having declined sharply in the first quarter, and the inventory of new homes for sale remained relatively large. On the other hand, sales of both new and existing homes rose moderately in March after sizable declines in February, and recent surveys indicated some improvement in attitudes toward homebuying.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods remained on a strong uptrend in March, with outlays for office and computing equipment registering another sharp increase. Manufacturers of heavy trucks continued to operate at capacity to meet demand; by contrast, business expenditures for motor vehicles reportedly plunged in April. Data on orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to further strong expansion of spending on business equipment in the months ahead, although gains appeared likely to be smaller than those of the past several quarters. Nonresidential construction continued to rise in March, and data on permits for new construction suggested that building activity would advance further in coming months, though perhaps at a somewhat slower rate.  Business inventories surged again in March, and the pace of inventory accumulation over the first quarter was substantially higher than the average rate for the second half of 1994. Much of the first-quarter increase in stocks reflected a buildup in inventories of motor vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels. Non-auto stocks also increased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, accompanied by the emergence of scattered signs of inventory imbalances in furniture, appliances, and apparel at the retail level and in construction supplies at earlier stages of production and distribution. The stock-to-sales ratio in manufacturing was unchanged in March from the very low fourth-quarter level. At the wholesale level, the ratio of inventories to sales rose in March but remained within the range of the last several years. Inventory accumulation in the retail sector slowed in March despite a further rise in inventories of motor vehicles. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio increased in March to the top end of its range of the last two years; when the motor vehicle components of stocks and sales are excluded, however, the ratio was near the middle of its range in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was little changed in March from the February level and remained substantially narrower than in January. On a quarterly average basis, the trade deficit widened in the first quarter as growth in the value of exports slowed while the expansion in the value of imports continued unabated. A drop in shipments to Mexico was among the factors holding down export growth in March. Data available for the first quarter indicated that economic recovery continued in the major foreign industrial countries as a group but that the pace varied significantly across countries. There were signs of sustained growth in the United Kingdom, slower growth in Canada, renewed recovery in Japan, and weakness in France and Italy.  Inflation had picked up somewhat in the early months of 1995. At the consumer level, prices rose a little more rapidly in the first quarter, despite unchanged food prices and lower energy prices. In April, a surge in food prices and a rebound in energy prices contributed to a further step-up in consumer inflation. At the producer level, prices of finished goods followed a roughly similar pattern, increasing at a slightly faster pace in the first quarter and then more briskly in April. The April rise partly reflected a sharp jump in the prices of finished energy goods, but prices of non-energy, nonfood items also advanced at a somewhat faster rate. At earlier stages of production, prices of intermediate materials continued to increase rapidly in April. By contrast, trends in labor compensation costs remained subdued. Gains in hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed further in the first quarter of 1995, with a continuing moderation in the cost of benefits accounting for all of the deceleration in compensation.  At its meeting on March 28, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in the broader monetary aggregates over coming months.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended higher over the period, reflecting a rising need for seasonal credit at the beginning of the planting season, while the federal funds rate continued to average close to 6 percent.  Most market interest rates moved lower over the intermeeting period in reaction to weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, which market participants interpreted as signaling a considerable slowing of the economic expansion and a growing likelihood that the next monetary policy move would be in an easing direction. Market assessments that the prospects for major reductions in budget deficits were improving also seemed to contribute to the drop in rates. In this environment, the release of data indicating large increases in consumer and producer prices for April only temporarily interrupted the decline in rates. Intermediate- and long-term interest rates posted the largest declines over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined substantially further over the first half of the intermeeting period. In mid-April, the dollar reached a record low against the Japanese yen and approached a record low against the German mark. The dollar's weakness appeared to have been related in part to further indications of softening economic activity and related declines in interest rates in the United States and to increasing trade tensions with Japan. Late in the period, the dollar reversed its course and moved up sharply against the yen and the mark; monetary easing abroad, improving prospects for reductions in the U.S. budget deficit, and stabilizing financial conditions in Mexico appeared to contribute to the turnaround. The dollar ended the intermeeting period higher on balance against the other G-10 currencies.  The growth of M2 picked up further in April, reflecting in part the need for additional liquid balances to make unusually heavy final tax payments; these payments resulted from the stronger economy in 1994 and from new tax regulations allowing individuals to delay a larger portion of their tax payments until April. The expansion of M2 also appeared to be boosted by the increased relative attractiveness of small time deposits and money market funds following declines in market interest rates. For the year through April, M2 grew at a rate in the lower half of its range for 1995 while M3 expanded at a rate somewhat above its range. The persisting strength of M3 in April largely reflected the needs of commercial banks to fund continuing heavy credit demands by households and businesses. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate a little above the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity was slowing somewhat more than previously anticipated, with the recent plunge in motor vehicle sales prompting a deeper-than-expected reduction in the production of cars and light trucks. Economic expansion would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output for a number of months, but the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally that had occurred in stock and bond markets were expected to provide underlying support for aggregate demand later in the year and in 1996. The forecast continued to anticipate that consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in real incomes and the satisfaction of pent-up demands for motor vehicles and other durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in response to the slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico might depress U.S. exports further, but mainly in the very near term given the size of the adjustments already evident in the Mexican current account. With this influence waning, sustained growth in the economies of other U.S. trading partners was expected to boost export demand. Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but the forecast maintained the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been assumed since early in the year. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some easing of pressures on resources suggested that price inflation would likely moderate from its recently higher level.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members reported on statistical and anecdotal indications of further slowing in the expansion of economic activity and some related easing of pressures on labor and other producer resources. A number commented that they anticipated a relatively sluggish economic performance over coming months as production was cut back to bring inventories into better balance with sales. However, underlying demand was likely to remain sufficiently robust, especially in light of developments in financial markets, to avert a cumulative decline in business activity and, indeed, to return economic growth to a pace broadly in line with potential. Members cited in particular the strength in business fixed investment and the potential for improvement in housing activity and the trade balance as factors that should help to sustain the expansion. Nonetheless, the longer-run outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially given the undecided course of fiscal policy and the ongoing inventory correction; the ultimate extent of that correction and its effects on overall economic performance were subject to a cyclical dynamic whose outcome could not be predicted with confidence. A worsening in key measures of inflation, including the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods, was a disappointing--if not unexpected--development. A number of members expressed concern that the risks were still tilted in the direction of some further step-up in inflation; however, others were more inclined to the view that inflation was not likely to rise much further in a climate of moderate growth in demand, intense competitive pressures in many markets, and relatively subdued increases in labor costs.  Members commented that a reduction in the rate of inventory investment was likely to be the dominant influence on the near-term performance of the economy. Some also saw a risk that a significantly greater-than-expected softening in inventory accumulation might have adverse, and possibly cumulative, effects of a longer-term nature on production and incomes and thus on consumer and business spending. With the exception of the motor vehicle industry, however, current inventory levels generally were quite low in relation to sales and potential inventory adjustments were likely to be limited in size. Once further inventory adjustments were completed, the rate of accumulation could be expected to remain well below the unsustainable pace experienced over the past year and perhaps settle into a pattern where changes in inventories became a relatively neutral factor in the ongoing economic expansion.  In their comments about broad factors underlying the economic outlook, members reported that current business and consumer sentiment remained generally favorable across the nation. Despite the softening demand in some markets or industries, notably that for motor vehicles, business contacts continued to express optimism about the outlook for their firms, though some of their comments were tempered by greater caution than had been observed earlier. A number of members referred to the general financial climate as an important element in the outlook for sustained economic expansion. They noted that the decline in interest rates had favorable implications for demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The rise in equity prices also was contributing to reductions in the cost of capital to businesses, and banks continued to ease terms and standards on loans. In addition, the rise in stock and bond prices had increased the net worth of many households, though some concern was expressed about the sustainability of the stock market's strong performance.  With regard to developments in key sectors of the economy, the slowdown in the growth of consumer spending was somewhat more pronounced than anticipated earlier. Some rebound in consumer demand seemed likely and already appeared to be occurring in the motor vehicle industry in May. Underlying conditions for further growth in consumer spending were viewed as relatively favorable; these conditions included strengthened balance sheets stemming from developments in financial markets, continued growth of incomes, and aggressive extensions of consumer credit by a number of lenders. In at least one view, however, consumer credit had been growing at a pace that could not be sustained and the inevitable correction could coincide with and exacerbate emerging weakness in consumer demand. On balance, growth in personal consumption expenditures was seen as likely to continue over coming quarters but at a reduced pace given the apparent satisfaction of a large portion of earlier pent-up demands for consumer durables and some expected moderation in the growth of jobs and incomes.  Business investment remained on a strong uptrend as numerous firms continued to respond to the need to relieve pressures on existing capacity and to increase operating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competition. Rapid growth in profits and a ready availability of financing also were cited as factors tending to support business investment spending. The increase in such spending was likely to moderate over the projection horizon, though to a still brisk pace, as declining growth in demand and easing pressures on capacity induced growing caution in business investment decisions. Indeed, the growth in expenditures for producer durable equipment already appeared to be moderating from an extremely rapid pace, though nonresidential construction was reported to be posting solid gains in several parts of the country.  Members also expected some strengthening in residential construction following the large declines in mortgage interest rates that had occurred since late 1994. Housing construction had trended lower since the start of the year, but several indicators pointed to a revival. The latter included surveys showing improving homebuyer attitudes and builder assessments of the outlook for new home sales, and rising applications to purchase homes. Sizable inventories of unsold new homes would probably continue to damp construction activity for some months, but contacts in the real estate and mortgage finance industries were more optimistic about the outlook for housing.  The foreign trade sector likewise was expected to make an appreciable contribution to the expansion of economic activity in coming quarters. The robust uptrend in U.S. exports during 1994 had been slowed to a considerable extent thus far this year by the sharp adjustment in trade with Mexico, but in the view of several members that adjustment might now be largely completed. In that event, gains in exports could be expected to resume at a fairly brisk pace despite indications of reduced economic growth in some key foreign countries. This assessment was supported by anecdotal reports of rising foreign demand for some U.S. products in the context of the generally improved international competitive position of the United States. Concurrently, growth in imports would tend to be held down by the projected slowing in the expansion of domestic demand. On the negative side, some members referred to the possibility that a longer period might be needed to resolve the difficulties being experienced by Mexico, and several expressed particular concern about the potential for relatively severe disruptions to trade if current negotiations with Japan were not successfully concluded.  Fiscal policy was seen as a major uncertainty in the economic outlook. Federal purchases of goods and services were expected to continue trending lower and the growth of transfer payments was likely to be trimmed, but the extent and timing of fiscal restraint could not be determined while federal deficit reduction continued to be debated in the Congress. In the view of at least some members, however, a larger fiscal contraction than was commonly expected might well materialize, perhaps starting later this year. The course of fiscal legislation undoubtedly would continue to affect financial markets and, in the opinion of some members, would need to be taken into account in the formulation of monetary policy.  Concerning inflation, several members commented that the rise in consumer prices and some other broad measures of inflation in recent months appeared to reflect cyclical developments relating to the tightening of resource and product markets over the past year, including the partial pass-through of sizable increases in prices at earlier stages of production. In addition, higher import prices might have been playing a role. A number of members expressed concern that, with the economy already producing at or even slightly above its sustainable potential, inflation pressures were likely to intensify if the current pause in the expansion were to be followed by a period of above-average growth. On the other hand, members who saw the odds as pointing to a more moderate rebound after a period of relatively sluggish economic performance were inclined to the view that an upward trend in inflation was likely to be averted. In addition, the ongoing competitive pressures in many markets, the restraint in compensation increases, and the continuing efforts to cut production costs would help to contain pressures on prices over time.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain the current stance of policy. The higher interest rates of 1994 clearly had damped demand, but since year-end intermediate- and long-term market rates had declined, stock market prices had risen, bank lending terms had continued to ease, and the dollar had fallen against the currencies of many major industrial countries. On balance, it appeared that the current configuration of financial market conditions and degree of monetary restraint was likely to be consistent with moderate expansion in nominal GDP and prices following a period of some weakness in the economy as inventory imbalances were corrected. The risks of a different outcome, in either direction, seemed to be reasonably balanced. In the circumstances, because the dimensions of the near-term deceleration and the potential strength of underlying demand remained uncertain, the members concluded that it was desirable to monitor developments carefully and wait for additional information before deciding on the next policy move.  With regard to the possible need to adjust policy during the intermeeting period, all the members were in favor of shifting to an unbiased instruction that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the direction of potential intermeeting changes. The members agreed that no compelling case could be made at this point for potential adjustments to policy in either direction during the period ahead, and retaining a bias in the directive would give a misleading indication of the Committee's current intentions for the period. One member expressed the view that the costs of being wrong currently seemed higher in the direction of accommodating too much inflation, though signs of a possible cumulative deterioration in economic activity could not be ignored should they materialize. Another member, who saw the longer-term risks to the economy as tilted to the downside of current projections, indicated that while the recent performance of the economy might argue for some easing of monetary policy, a steady policy course without any bias in the intermeeting instruction was appropriate for now in light of the generally accomodative financial and banking markets.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion of economic activity has slowed considerably further. In April, nonfarm payroll employment was about unchanged after posting reduced gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. Industrial production fell in April, largely reflecting a cutback in the production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization rates declined somewhat. Reflecting markedly weaker demand for motor vehicles, total retail sales were down in April after rising moderately over the first quarter. Housing starts were unchanged in April after declining sharply in the first quarter. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to further strong expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in the first quarter from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have increased faster on average thus far this year, while advances in labor compensation costs have remained subdued.  Intermediate- and long-term interest rates have declined considerably further since the Committee meeting on March 28, while short-term rates have registered small decreases. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies, after falling to low levels, rose on balance over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 strengthened in March and April. For the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate in the lower half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate somewhat above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate a bit above the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee anticipated that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the level of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter. Consumer spending apparently remained sluggish, and business spending on plant and equipment rose less rapidly than in other recent quarters. With final sales flagging, firms sought to hold down production and employment in order to keep inventories under control. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased faster on balance thus far this year, but signs of some moderation in inflation were evident in recent price data. Growth of labor compensation costs remained subdued.  Nonfarm payroll employment fell substantially in May after a small decline in April and reduced gains in the first quarter. Payrolls in the services industry continued to rise in May, but the pace of hiring was well below the average rate of increase over other recent months. In manufacturing and construction, employment contracted further in May, although part of the job decline in construction might have been temporary, reflecting heavy rains and floods in the South. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower in May, to 5.7 percent, but was somewhat above its average for the first quarter.  Industrial production continued to weaken in May, and incoming data suggested a further decline in June. Manufacturing output fell in May for a fourth consecutive month, reflecting another cutback in the production of motor vehicles. Output of non-auto manufactured goods was unchanged, with increases in the production of nondurable consumer goods and non-auto business equipment offsetting declines in output elsewhere. Utilization of manufacturing capacity dropped again in May but was still at a relatively high level.  Nominal retail sales were about unchanged over April and May. Purchases at furniture and appliance stores were up slightly on balance over the two months. Sales at automotive dealerships and apparel outlets fell in April but revived somewhat in May. Spending at building materials stores fell in both months. The retail sales reports, in combination with data on consumer prices and unit motor-vehicle sales, suggested that inflation-adjusted spending for consumer goods had changed little since the fourth quarter of last year. Housing starts were unchanged on balance over April and May; a reduction in starts of single-family homes was offset by a rise in starts of multifamily units. Adverse weather in some parts of the country might have contributed to the sluggishness in starts. Home sales were higher in May: Sales of new homes turned up sharply, and sales of existing homes also advanced somewhat.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods increased considerably in May after being unchanged in April. Shipments of computing equipment remained robust on balance over April and May, but growth of shipments of other business equipment slowed significantly. Sales of heavy trucks rebounded strongly in May from an April decline. Recent data on new orders for nondefense capital goods suggested that spending on business equipment might moderate somewhat in the months ahead after an extended period of rapid expansion. Nonresidential construction continued to trend appreciably higher in April; particularly large gains were recorded in the public utility, industrial, and institutional categories.  Business inventories grew at a little slower rate in April than in the first quarter. In manufacturing, inventory investment remained brisk in April but slowed somewhat in May; the inventory-to-sales ratio for the two months was at the high end of the range for the past year. At the wholesale level, the rate of increase in stocks in April equaled the first-quarter pace and the ratio of stocks to sales reached its highest level in several years. Inventory accumulation in the retail sector was more moderate in April. More than half the rise occurred at automotive establishments. The inventory-to-sales ratio for retailers other than auto dealers had remained stable for a number of months and was near the middle of its range for recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in April from its average rate for the first quarter. The value of imports was up sharply, with increases posted in nearly all major import categories. The value of exports rose modestly from the first-quarter level; increases in exports of aircraft and industrial supplies were partially offset by declines in exports of automotive products to Canada and Mexico. Available data indicated that, on average, economic growth in the major foreign industrial countries had been sluggish in the first quarter and apparently had remained so in the second quarter; growth had been particularly weak in Canada and Japan.  Incoming data suggested that price inflation might be slowing a little after having picked up early in the year. Consumer prices rose a bit less in May; energy prices recorded another sizable increase, but food prices changed little and prices of other items advanced more slowly. However, for the twelve months ended in May, prices of nonfood, non-energy consumer items increased slightly more than in the preceding twelve months. At the producer level, prices of finished goods were unchanged in May, reflecting declines in the prices of finished foods and finished energy goods; excluding food and energy, prices of finished goods rose in May at the same rate as in April. For the year ending in May, producer prices rose moderately after being essentially unchanged in the previous year. At earlier stages of production, producer prices grew at a considerably slower rate or declined in May, suggesting some easing of cost pressures over the next few months. Average hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated in the first quarter of the year, owing in large part to temporary developments. Over the year ended in March, this compensation measure increased somewhat more than it had over the previous year. Average hourly earnings declined in May, but the change in hourly earnings over the past twelve months was slightly larger than the advance over the preceding twelve-month period.  At its meeting on May 23, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate generally remained near 6 percent, but most short-term interest rates were down on balance in response to incoming economic data, particularly the employment report for May, that were seen by market participants as increasing the likelihood that monetary policy would be eased in the near future. Longer-term interest rates also declined in reaction to growing indications that efforts to narrow substantially the U.S. budget deficit might be successful. Yields on corporate and municipal obligations fell less than Treasury rates and risk spreads widened a little, particularly for junk bonds. Major indexes of equity prices rose over the intermeeting period, partly in response to lower interest rates.  In foreign exchange markets over the intermeeting period, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined considerably on balance. The dollar fell sharply in the week after the May meeting on further news of weakening in the U.S. economy but rebounded somewhat at the end of the month when concerted central-bank intervention was carried out. The dollar remained relatively stable over the balance of the period.  Growth of M2 strengthened substantially in May and June. Downward adjustments in returns on deposits and retail money fund shares had lagged declines in market interest rates in recent months, and investors evidently responded by shifting funds from market instruments into these M2 assets. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995. M3 also accelerated in May and June; and for the year through June, this aggregate grew at a rate well above the annual range set in February. The pickup in M3 growth importantly reflected more rapid inflows to institution-only money funds, whose yields also adjusted sluggishly to falling money market rates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand sluggishly over the next few months as business firms adjusted production schedules to bring inventories into better alignment with sales. Subsequently, as inventory positions were corrected, and with underlying support for final sales from the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in the equity and debt markets, the economy would begin to expand at a moderate pace. The forecast assumed a modest step-up in the pace of consumer spending in response to some diminution of concerns about job prospects and incomes as well as improved financial conditions and household balance sheets. Homebuilding was projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability. Business outlays for new equipment were expected to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years in response to the slower growth of sales and profits, but lower costs of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable growth in such investment. Export expansion would pick up in response to some anticipated strengthening in the economies of major U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but in light of recent developments the forecast now reflected a greater degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would moderate from its recently higher level.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the apparent pause in the expansion was likely to prove temporary, and their forecasts generally pointed to an upturn in overall economic activity to a pace in the neighborhood of the economy's potential by the latter part of this year or early 1996. Many emphasized that the prospects for a strengthening economy were enhanced by the drop in intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the rise in equity prices. In the view of most members, however, the risks to the outlook were tilted to the downside. Several stressed that the ongoing adjustments to business inventories could prove to be more pronounced and of longer duration than they anticipated, with negative repercussions on production and incomes and in turn on consumer spending and business investment. Other downside risks included the adverse implications for exports of potentially less-than-projected expansion in a number of major foreign economies. Nonetheless, recent developments suggested that the period of maximum risk to the domestic expansion might have passed. With pressures on resources having diminished and likely to ease somewhat further and with labor costs remaining subdued, the risk of continuing increases in inflation had fallen considerably; indeed, in the view of many members inflation should moderate over the projection period.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided their individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1995 and 1996. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1995 as a whole had a central tendency of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, reflecting expectations of a pickup in growth to a moderate pace in the second half of the year; for 1996, projections of growth in real GDP centered on a range of 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the growth forecasts were concentrated in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent for 1995 and 4-3/4 to 5-3/8 percent for 1996. The rate of unemployment associated with these forecasts was expected to edge higher in the second half of this year to a consensus range of 5-3/4 to 6-1/8 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1995 and 1996. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, pointed to a small decline over the projection horizon; the projections converged on rates of 3-1/8 to 3-3/8 percent for 1995 and 2-7/8 to 3-1/4 percent for 1996.  In the course of the discussion, members indicated that much of the economic information that had become available since the May meeting had suggested a greater softening in the economy than they had anticipated and had raised concerns about the timing and strength of the upturn over coming quarters. However, the most recent data and some of the anecdotal reports from around the country had a better tone. Among the positive factors in the economic outlook, members gave particular emphasis to the favorable financial climate, including the stimulative effects of lower interest rates on interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, the ready availability of financing from market sources and banking institutions, and the impact of rising equity and bond prices on balance sheets. Business and consumer sentiment also remained generally favorable, though anecdotal reports suggested a heightened degree of caution among business contacts in many parts of the nation. Members observed that the expansion did not appear to have produced overall imbalances in the economy aside from an apparent overhang of inventories in some industries. The ongoing adjustments needed to bring these inventories down to desired levels were seen as the most serious threat to the expansion. Some members commented that the inventory correction in the second quarter appeared on the basis of the available evidence to be less than was expected earlier and that the period of inventory adjustment might therefore be more extended in time than they had anticipated. While such a development might not in itself be sufficient to tilt the economy into recession, in the possible context of relatively sluggish growth in final demands, the economy would be vulnerable to adverse domestic or external shocks. On balance, while the timing remained uncertain, a resumption of growth at a moderate rate was viewed as a likely prospect, given the underlying strength of the economy.  In their review of prospective developments in key sectors of the economy, members noted that consumer expenditures had fallen short of earlier expectations, but signs of some firming were visible, notably the indications of an improvement in sales of motor vehicles since early spring. While a continued sluggish performance of the consumer sector could not be ruled out, the members generally expected a resumption of moderate growth in consumer spending. The upturn undoubtedly would be limited to some extent by the apparent exhaustion of much of the earlier pent-up demands and perhaps by concerns about job prospects and incomes, but the effects of reduced interest rates on borrowers and the wealth effects from gains in values of financial assets should help to sustain moderate growth. Moreover, if the strengthening in housing activity materialized as projected, sales of consumer durables would be favorably affected. While consumer confidence had declined earlier, recent surveys indicated that confidence had stabilized or even edged up more recently and was in any event at relatively high levels in most parts of the country.  Business fixed investment appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year, though expenditures for both producer durable equipment and nonresidential structures were still registering strong gains. Further moderation was anticipated over the course of coming quarters in association with slower growth in business sales and decreased pressures on producer resources. While some concern was expressed about the vulnerability of capital spending to a downturn in the growth of sales, the members generally expected this sector of the economy to remain a positive factor in the expansion. The ready availability of financing on favorable terms and the ongoing need to modernize equipment and other producer resources for competitive reasons, notably to take advantage of continuing improvements in computer and other technologies, should foster continued overall growth in business investment. Members also noted that the strength in business profits, though likely to moderate cyclically at some point, remained a favorable factor undergirding business capital spending.  Housing activity had stagnated in recent months, but this sector of the economy also was expected to provide some stimulus to the expansion as home buyers responded to reduced mortgage rates. Although the latest available data indicated that housing starts were still relatively depressed, home sales and mortgage loan applications for home purchases had strengthened recently. With some exceptions, building industry contacts in local areas tended to confirm broader indications that improvement in housing activity was occurring. Members also noted that rising occupancy levels and rents should support fairly robust construction of multifamily housing in many areas.  With regard to the outlook for fiscal policy, members gave considerable emphasis to recent developments in Congress which suggested that there could be greater deficit reduction over the years ahead than had been built into many forecasts. The direct effects of deficit cutbacks would tend to hold down the growth in final demand and act as a restraining influence on overall economic activity over the projection horizon. But those cutbacks also would have favorable effects on financial markets, thereby stimulating to an extent offsetting increases in spending. Over the longer run, deficit reduction should enhance the performance and growth of the economy, though monetary policy makers would need to carefully monitor possible transition effects.  A considerable downside risk in the view of many members was the outlook for exports. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the first half of the year, and this raised questions about the strength of the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the faster growth in U.S. exports. Most of the major economies in Latin America also were projected to strengthen, and indeed such expectations were reflected in financial markets, but substantial problems remained that could undermine the favorable outlook. On the positive side, members observed that U.S. exports were now quite competitive in world markets, as evidenced by continuing gains in exports to numerous countries, and such a perception was reinforced by anecdotal reports of increasing foreign sales of a variety of products by firms around the country. On balance, some growth in exports remained a reasonable prospect but it might fall below current expectations.  The members generally agreed that the inflation risks in the economy had diminished, though some still saw the potential for little or no progress in unwinding the recent uptick in inflation. Many referred to indications of easing pressures on resources in recent months, and they generally felt that such pressures would be contained over the projection horizon if economic growth were to materialize in line with their forecasts. Developments seen as consistent with such an expectation included persisting anecdotal reports of highly competitive markets that made it very difficult for business firms to pass on cost increases or to raise profit margins. Moreover, despite continuing reports of labor scarcities in some areas and industries, increases in nominal labor costs generally had remained subdued across the nation. Prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods had increased sharply in earlier months and these increases would continue to put upward pressure on the prices of finished goods, but there recently had been signs of some abatement of inflation at the earlier stages of production. Similarly, earlier declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were placing upward pressure on the prices of many imported products, but the recent stability of the dollar promised a diminution of such pressure over time. On balance, most of the members believed that the underlying trend of inflation was now tilted toward gradual deceleration in the context of marginally higher rates of unemployed labor and other resources, but they acknowledged that the risks to such an outcome remained substantial.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they favored or could support a proposal to ease slightly the current degree of pressure on reserve positions. Preferences for an unchanged policy stance and for somewhat greater easing also were expressed. In support of at least slight easing, members commented that they viewed current monetary policy as somewhat restrictive, judged in part by the level of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate. This degree of monetary restraint had been appropriate early in the year when the economy was operating at or possibly beyond its long-run potential and inflation pressures appeared to be mounting. Some modest easing was desirable now that the growth of the economy had slowed considerably more than anticipated and potential inflationary pressures seemed to be in the process of receding. Although inflation was higher than in 1994 and the economy was still operating at an elevated level, looking forward many members saw prospects for declining inflation and the possibility of shortfalls in economic growth. The members agreed that under present economic conditions a slight easing of the stance of policy would incur little risk of stimulating increased inflation and would be entirely consistent with their commitment to continued progress toward price stability over time. Several members also observed that any move toward less restraint should be cautious at this point because easing would represent a change in the direction of policy and its repercussions on financial markets, including the foreign exchange markets, could be relatively pronounced.  A few members preferred somewhat greater easing. They stressed that such a move was warranted by the recent pause in the expansion and the apparent vulnerability of the economy to a variety of downside risks. Indeed, a move from what they saw as a restrictive monetary policy toward a more neutral policy stance was somewhat overdue in their view. While they could support a slight adjustment to policy at this point, these members were persuaded that the stance of monetary policy probably would need to be eased by more than a slight amount over time to accommodate the intermediate- and long-term needs of an expanding economy. Moreover, the risks of increasing inflationary pressures appeared to be relatively remote in the context of the current and anticipated performance of the overall economy. The declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates were helping to support the expansion, but those declines rested in part on market expectations of significant monetary policy easing; failure to ratify such expectations could well result in at least a partial reversal of those desirably lower rates.  Members who leaned toward an unchanged policy remained concerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and whether a somewhat easier policy stance would be consistent with the objective of capping inflation and setting the stage for further progress toward price stability. The available evidence on the economy's current performance remained mixed and most forecasts pointed to moderate strengthening ahead; in the circumstances an easing move did not appear to be needed at this time. One member emphasized that, while the risks of greater inflation seemed small, the costs of a policy error in the direction of too much easing would be high in terms of its effects on the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy and the need to rein in inflationary growth next year. Although their preference would be to wait for further evidence on the performance of the economy, all but one of these members indicated that, given the current uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook and the small amount of easing that was proposed, they would not dissent from the majority position.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, most of the members who favored some easing also preferred an asymmetric directive, including a marked preference on the part of those who supported greater easing than the majority. An asymmetric directive was consistent with the view shared by most members that the risks to the expansion were biased to the downside, but no member expressed a strong presumption about the likely need to ease policy during the weeks ahead. The Committee would, of course, monitor and respond as needed to the incoming economic information.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they favored or could support a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible further easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater monetary restraint might be acceptable or somewhat lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the level of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell in April and May after posting reduced gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent in May, was up somewhat from its first-quarter average. Industrial production continued to decline in May, reflecting another cutback in the production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have been sluggish on average in recent months. Housing starts were about unchanged over April and May, but sales of new homes turned up sharply in May. Orders for nondefense capital goods have moderated somewhat in recent months but still point to considerable further expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April from its average rate in the first quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have increased faster on average thus far this year, though there were signs of some moderation in the most recent data; advances in labor compensation costs have remained subdued.  Most interest rates have declined somewhat further since the Committee meeting on May 23. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined considerably over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 strengthened substantially in May and June. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate well above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Blinder, Kelley, Lindsey, Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and Yellen.  Vote against this action: Mr. Hoenig.  Mr. Hoenig dissented because he believed the stance of monetary policy should remain unchanged at this time. With the pace of economic activity likely to return to trend growth later this year and inflation expected to be higher this year and next than in 1994, he felt an unchanged policy in the near term would enhance the prospects of achieving the Committee's long-run objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.",199507,0,340,1995-07-31,-0.39,-0.06,-0.04,-0.28,-0.77,-0.24,-0.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1995-07-06

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding more rapidly after increasing at a sluggish pace in the second quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be growing at a moderate rate, housing demand seemed to be rebounding sharply, and business investment remained on a solid uptrend. With efforts to adjust inventories still under way, industrial production had changed little in recent months, and employment gains had been modest. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly in recent months. Advances in labor compensation costs remained subdued.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose further in July after a modest second-quarter gain; the July advance was held down by continuing employment losses in manufacturing that were widespread by industry. Outside of manufacturing, payrolls continued to increase at a relatively slow pace in July; reduced job growth in the services industry reflected smaller increases in employment at business and health service establishments. The civilian unemployment rate rose slightly in July, returning to its second-quarter average of 5.7 percent.  Industrial production edged higher in July, but it was unchanged on balance over the three months ending in July after declining in earlier months. Manufacturing output fell further in July; a sharp contraction in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for the entire decline. Within manufacturing, output of business equipment other than motor vehicles continued to advance as additional strong gains were recorded in the production of office and computing equipment. The output of non-auto consumer goods weakened; a cutback in the production of home furnishings offset an increase in the manufacture of appliances. With capacity continuing to expand rapidly, total utilization of industrial capacity dropped somewhat further.  Despite edging down in July, revised data for earlier months suggested that total retail sales had risen appreciably on balance since early spring. The July decline entirely reflected weakness in motor vehicles; elsewhere, spending on furniture and appliances continued to firm, and purchases of other durable goods and of apparel rose sharply. Housing market activity picked up considerably in June, with sales of both new and existing homes increasing significantly. Housing starts were up strongly in July after changing little in previous months.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods, led by surging purchases of computing equipment, continued to grow rapidly in the second quarter. However, business spending for transportation equipment, notably heavy trucks and aircraft, was lackluster. New orders for nondefense capital goods edged lower in the second quarter after rising sharply early this year, although the elevated level of order backlogs pointed to considerable further expansion of spending on business equipment over coming months. Nonresidential construction activity posted a solid gain in the second quarter, and recent data on permits suggested further increases in building activity in coming months.  Business inventory accumulation slowed markedly further in June, and inventory-to-sales ratios for most types of business establishments declined again. In manufacturing, the aggregate inventory-to-sales ratio was only a little above the historical low reached around the end of 1994. In the wholesale sector, the ratio of stocks to sales in June was slightly below the top of the range prevailing over the last year. At the retail level, inventories changed little in June, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was near the middle of its range for recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in June, with exports declining marginally more than imports. For the second quarter as a whole, the deficit was substantially larger than in the first quarter. Exports were up considerably in the second quarter despite declines in automotive products shipped to Canada and Mexico, but imports rose by even more, with increases widely spread across most major trade categories. In the major foreign industrial countries, economic growth appeared to have ranged from weak to moderate in the second quarter, and the limited available evidence suggested that subdued expansion continued into the third quarter. Economic activity remained particularly weak in Japan. In Europe, expansion apparently was still under way, though somewhat unevenly across countries.  Consumer prices rose more slowly in June and July, with food and energy price movements having little effect on the overall index; price increases for nonfood, non-energy items were somewhat smaller than those seen earlier in the year. Over the twelve-month period ended in July, however, this measure of consumer inflation rose at about the same rate as in the preceding twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods edged lower on balance in June and July, reflecting substantial declines in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding food and energy, producer prices rose by more over the year ended in July than over the preceding year. At earlier stages of production, increases in producer prices had diminished sharply in recent months, perhaps suggesting some abatement of pressures on production capacity and prices. Total hourly compensation for private industry workers increased somewhat more in the second quarter than in the first; however, the rise in compensation costs for the year ended in June was smaller than that for the previous year, primarily reflecting slower growth in costs of benefits. Average hourly earnings grew faster in July than in June; for the year ending in July, earnings rose somewhat more than in the preceding year.  At its meeting on July 5-6, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a tilt toward possible further easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Immediately after the meeting, open market operations were directed toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of reserve pressure that had been adopted by the Committee. Thereafter, operations were conducted with a view to maintaining this slightly more accommodative reserve posture, and the federal funds rate remained near 5-3/4 percent over the intermeeting interval. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above anticipated levels, largely reflecting heavy adjustment borrowing activity on the August 2 reserve settlement day when demands for excess reserves were unexpectedly large.  Treasury yields declined across the maturity spectrum in response to the announcement of the easing action on July 6; market participants perceived the policy move as an indication of the Federal Reserve's concern regarding the state of the economy and, based on historical precedent, as likely the first in a series of easing steps. Subsequently, however, interest rates rebounded in response to incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting stronger economic performance and reduced chances for further monetary policy easing. On balance, short-term market interest rates posted mixed changes over the intermeeting period, while intermediate- and long-term rates rose appreciably. With unexpectedly favorable corporate earnings reports outweighing the effects of higher interest rates, major indexes of equity prices were up moderately on balance over the period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated substantially over the intermeeting period. The dollar's gain occurred partly in response to the improving outlook for the U.S. economy and the related rise in long-term interest rates in the United States. Declines in long-term yields in the major European industrial countries probably contributed to a higher value of the dollar in terms of the German mark and most other European currencies. In addition, the dollar appreciated sharply against the Japanese yen, largely in response to actions by Japanese authorities to reduce official interest rates, to encourage capital outflows from Japan, and to make large intervention purchases of dollars during a period when the dollar already was rising against the yen.  M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases in July and appeared to be expanding considerably further in August. The recent strength of M2 seemed to reflect in part the relatively greater appeal of interest rates on M2 assets in the wake of the declines in market interest rates that had taken place this year, particularly at longer maturities. Robust M3 growth was associated with the continuing requirements of commercial banks for additional wholesale funds needed to meet persisting strong loan growth. For the year through July, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995, and M3 grew at a rate above its upwardly revised range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had been in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity would pick up from the weak pace of the second quarter. The inventory adjustment process appeared to be well under way, and moderate expansion of final sales would be supported by the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets. In response to improved financial conditions and balance sheets, consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of incomes. Homebuilding was expected to strengthen somewhat in response to the earlier decline in mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability. Accompanying slower growth of sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major trading partners. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the staff continued to anticipate the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been projected at the time of the last Committee meeting. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some further easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent trends.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members focused on recent indications of some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity after a period of limited growth during the spring. Further growth in final demand was generating an improvement in overall business activity, despite a more rapid adjustment in inventory investment than many had expected. This configuration suggested that the risks of recession or an extended period of subpar growth were now reduced, and sustained expansion at a moderate pace was seen as the most likely course for the economy. Although the risks to the economy now seemed to be more evenly balanced than at the time of the July meeting, they were still sizable in both directions. In particular, uncertainties about federal budget policies and their effects on the economy remained substantial. With respect to prices, members noted that the recent pause in the expansion had eased pressures on resources, and the economy appeared to be in a better position to accommodate moderate growth over the forecast horizon without adding to inflation. Indeed, some members were optimistic that growth of the economy at a pace in line with their expectations would be consistent with modest further decreases in inflation. Others expressed concern, however, that the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy included questions about the persistence of inflationary sentiment and the prospects for further progress toward stable prices over the next several quarters.  Members gave particular attention to the ongoing discussions involving the Congress and the Administration regarding future federal budget deficits. There was a great deal of political support for reducing the federal deficit substantially over the years ahead; indeed, in the view of one member the political dynamics might very well result in larger reductions than many now anticipated. Nonetheless, the actual outcome remained particularly uncertain. From the perspective of its macroeconomic stabilization effects and its implications for monetary policy, enactment of legislation involving substantial fiscal restraint would raise the issue of fiscal drag; however, the latter's impact on the economy would have to be judged in the context of attendant adjustments in market interest rates and, more broadly, in the light of emerging economic conditions. A legislative package containing strong fiscal restraint measures would be expected to ease pressures in debt markets--indeed, enhanced prospects in this regard were probably already contributing to reduced long-term interest rates. On the other hand, a package that included only modest deficit reduction might well lead to upward pressure on interest rates. The continuing uncertainty concerning the size of future budget deficits might be complicated by a delay in passing appropriations legislation in the months ahead, with potentially dislocative effects on many federal government operations. Accordingly, federal budget developments were seen as the major factor likely to bear on the performance of the economy over coming months and quarters, and these developments might well differ considerably from current forecasts.  Members described current business conditions across the nation as ranging from sluggish in some regions to robust in a number of others, with at least some improvement occurring recently in many parts of the country. There were anecdotal reports of strengthening retail sales in numerous areas, with the notable exception of motor vehicles, and of relatively high levels of confidence among consumers and many retailers. Sustained growth in consumer spending was seen as a reasonable expectation for the projection period through 1996. However, diminished pent-up demands and possibly the increasing level of consumer indebtedness would tend to inhibit consumer spending, keeping its growth below that in recent years. These negative factors might be offset to some extent by the wealth effects of the rise in stock market prices and by a higher level of housing activity that should help to support demands for household durables.  Members referred to recent indications, including widespread anecdotal reports, of considerable gains in housing activity after a period of pronounced weakness during the earlier months of the year. Homebuyers were reacting favorably to the declines in rates on fixed-rate mortgages from their highs around the turn of the year. Homebuilders in a number of areas were reported to be optimistic about the outlook for further gains in housing demand, at least for single-family homes. The prospects for multifamily construction seemed less promising; while robust activity characterized such construction in a number of areas, still high vacancy rates and associated overbuilding across much of the nation suggested little, if any, overall impetus from this sector of the housing industry.  The expansion in nonresidential construction was projected to slow from its pace in recent quarters in line with more moderate growth in overall economic activity and reduced pressures on capacity. Even so, with the slowing occurring only gradually as projects under construction were completed, this sector of the economy was expected to remain a positive factor in the overall expansion of economic activity over the next several quarters. The members also anticipated more moderate growth in outlays for producers' durable equipment over the forecast horizon in conjunction with slower growth in final sales. However, current trends pointed to further sizable increases in outlays for office and computing equipment, and such expenditures were expected to buttress still considerable overall growth in spending for business equipment, though at a pace well below the exceptional rate experienced in recent years.  Members commented that the adjustment in business inventories appeared to have progressed a considerable distance but probably was not yet completed for the business sector as a whole. Nonetheless, inventory investment seemed likely to become a more neutral factor in its effects on the overall economy as desired inventory ratios were reached in an increasing number of industries. The recent tendency for order patterns to stabilize was a tentative indication of such a development. In any event, the recent upturn in final sales, apart from its probable effects on desired inventory levels, had allowed a larger-than-expected amount of inventory correction to occur without preventing the economy from regaining at least moderate expansionary momentum.  The external sector of the economy remained subject to particular uncertainty. The members generally viewed some improvement in the country's net export position as a reasonable expectation, but several questioned the potential for much expansion of exports to many of the nation's important trading partners. While recent policy actions in Japan might have diminished concerns about the outlook for overall exports, a number of members indicated that they continued to anticipate fairly limited growth in foreign demands for U.S. goods and services, with the result that the external sector was likely in their view to make a relatively small, if any, contribution to the growth of the domestic economy over the projection period.  Members generally viewed the near-term outlook for inflation as more encouraging than it had appeared to be earlier this year. The pause in the expansion during the spring had eased pressures on resources, as evidenced in part by anecdotal reports of lessening labor shortages in some areas and reduced use of overtime work by some firms, and the higher rate of inflation experienced during the early months of the year seemed unlikely to persist. The members differed somewhat, however, in their assessment of the longer-term outlook for inflation. Some emphasized the reduction that had occurred in inflationary pressures, and with labor costs remaining subdued they felt that economic growth in line with current forecasts should prove compatible with moderating inflation over time. Further, the recent appreciation of the dollar should contribute marginally to a more favorable inflation outcome after some lag. Other members expressed reservations about the prospects for an improved inflation performance over coming quarters. They cited indications of persisting inflationary expectations such as the recent weakness of the bond markets and survey results that pointed to expectations of some rise in inflation from current levels. They also referred to the possibility that favorable labor cost developments would not persist indefinitely in an economy that was operating in the vicinity of its potential.  Turning to monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members accepted a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets and to adopt a directive that was not biased in either direction with regard to potential intermeeting adjustments. For the near term, current trends in economic activity and inflation appeared favorable and likely to remain so with an unchanged policy stance. A steady policy also seemed appropriate pending a clearer assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy. Over the longer term, the members generally believed that consideration would need to be given to an adjustment in the Committee's policy stance, especially if substantial fiscal restraint were to be enacted. The extent to which an adjustment might be needed later in the stance of monetary policy --characterized by some members as slightly to the restrictive side at least in terms of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate --would have to be assessed in terms of its consistency with the Committee's continuing objectives of fostering price stability and promoting sustained economic growth.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they would vote for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. They also favored a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with more moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in the current quarter from the weak second-quarter pace. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in June and July after declining in May; the advance was held down by continuing employment losses in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate in July was at its second-quarter average of 5.7 percent. Industrial production changed little in recent months after falling earlier while capacity utilization was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have risen appreciably on balance since early spring, but they edged down in July, reflecting weakness in motor vehicles. Housing starts were up sharply in July after changing little in previous months. Orders for nondefense capital goods still point to considerable further expansion of spending on business equipment over coming months; nonresidential construction has continued to trend appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in the second quarter from its average rate in the first quarter. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in recent months. Advances in labor compensation costs have remained subdued.  Short-term interest rates have posted mixed changes since the Committee meeting on July 5-6, while intermediate- and long-term rates have risen appreciably. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated substantially over the intermeeting period, with the gain occurring since the beginning of August.  M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases in July and appeared to be expanding considerably further in August. For the year through July, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate above its upwardly revised range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with more moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the current quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be advancing somewhat further after a sizable gain in the second quarter; housing demand had strengthened in response to earlier reductions in mortgage rates; and business investment remained on a solid uptrend. Although business efforts to pare inventories apparently were still in progress, both production and employment were advancing moderately. After having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly in recent months.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in August after changing little in July. Much of the rise reflected a pickup in hiring in the services industry, notably in business services. Manufacturing payrolls were up modestly in August; the gain followed substantial declines in the previous four months. Construction employment changed little on balance over July and August, with only small changes being posted each month. The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.6 percent in August, remaining in the narrow range that had prevailed since late 1994.  Industrial production jumped in August to a level moderately above its average for the second quarter. Manufacturing output rose sharply, posting its first increase since January; a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for some of the advance, but the output of non-automotive consumer goods in August more than reversed a sizable drop in July, and the production of business equipment recorded another robust gain. A steep rise in electricity generation associated with unusually hot weather over much of the country more than offset a decline in mining production. Total utilization of industrial capacity moved higher in August but remained below the average rate for the first quarter.  Retail sales were up slightly on balance over July and August after rising appreciably in the previous two months. Abstracting from the volatile sales of motor vehicles during this period, spending on goods changed little on balance over the two months, as increased outlays for durable goods were offset by flagging purchases of apparel. Spending on services rose in July (latest data available) owing in part to elevated demand for energy-related services during that month's unseasonably warm weather. Housing market activity increased further in July and August. Sales of both new and existing homes in July (latest data) reached their highest levels in more than a year, and housing starts edged up in August after a substantial rise in July.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell appreciably in July after having risen rapidly over the first half of the year, and sales of heavy trucks also were down substantially. New orders for nondefense capital goods declined steeply in July: however, the still-large backlog of outstanding orders, coupled with the favorable effects on the user cost of capital of lower interest rates and higher equity prices this year, pointed to further substantial expansion of spending on business equipment over coming months. Nonresidential construction posted another sizable gain in July. Outlays for office, industrial, and institutional structures registered healthy increases, but other commercial building activity was unchanged.  Business inventory accumulation slowed in June and July from a very rapid rate earlier in the year: stockpiling continued at a brisk pace in manufacturing and wholesale trade, but retail stocks were drawn down. In manufacturing, stocks increased in July at about the average rate seen in the second quarter; however, the stocks-to-shipments ratio rose somewhat, reflecting in part a reduction in shipments that might have been exaggerated by difficulties of seasonal adjustment. Wholesale inventories also advanced at about the second-quarter pace, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector moved up to the upper end of its range for recent years. At the retail level, reduced stocks at automotive dealers accounted for much of the July decline in inventories; the ratio of inventories to sales edged lower but remained near the middle of the range for recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened slightly in July from its average rate in the second quarter. The value of both exports and imports decreased. For exports, the largest decline was in aircraft and automotive products. The decrease in imports was concentrated in automotive products and gold. Available indicators of economic activity suggested that expansion was continuing in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the third quarter and that the average rate of growth remained near the subdued pace of the first half of the year.  As in other recent months, consumer prices rose more slowly in August than in the early months of the year. Sizable declines in energy prices were a contributing factor, but price increases also had moderated for nonfood, non-energy items; the moderation largely reflected a downturn in automobile finance charges and used-car prices along with smaller increases in airline fares. For the twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices rose by the same amount as in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged lower in August after being unchanged in July. Although declines in prices of finished energy goods held down the overall index in both months, prices of finished goods other than food and energy rose more slowly than in the early months of the year; for the twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices of finished goods increased slightly more than in the comparable year-earlier period.  At its meeting on August 22, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with more moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing and the federal funds rate generally were in line with expectations, with the funds rate averaging close to 5-3/4 percent. Other market interest rates fell appreciably over much of the period, though these declines were partially reversed near the end of the period. Further evidence of subdued price pressures, indications that the rebound in growth of GDP would be modest, and increasing confidence that significant reductions in federal deficits might be in train contributed to the drop in rates. The lower interest rates, optimistic assessments of corporate earnings, and the brisk pace of merger announcements and share buybacks helped lift major indexes of equity prices to new record levels during the period, though they ended the period below those highs.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined over the intermeeting period. The dollar moved higher over most of the period, partly in response to monetary easing actions in Germany, which were quickly followed by similar steps in other European countries, and in Japan. The policy easing in Japan was accompanied, inter alia, by statements by U.S. and Japanese officials that they would welcome a weaker yen. The dollar reversed course late in the intermeeting period, however, following the announcement of a new Japanese fiscal package and emerging uncertainties about the prospects for European monetary union. On balance over the period, the dollar moved lower against most European currencies while appreciating significantly further against the yen.  After further strong expansion in August, M2 and M3 appeared to be growing at a somewhat more moderate rate in September. The still-brisk demand for M2 assets was associated with the lower market interest rates now prevailing and the related decline in the opportunity costs associated with holding these assets. The relatively robust growth of M3 reflected inflows to institution-only money market funds as well as bank acquisitions of wholesale funds to meet loan demand. For the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate appreciably above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity over the forecast horizon would be higher than the weak pace of the second quarter. The process of bringing inventories into better alignment with sales was well under way, and the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets would tend to support moderate expansion of final sales. Consumer spending was expected to grow at a pace generally in line with incomes; the favorable effects on spending of higher prices for financial assets held by households would be offset to a degree in this forecast by less robust labor market conditions and the difficulties that growing numbers of households would encounter in servicing their enlarged debts. Homebuilding was expected to be somewhat stronger in response to the earlier decline in mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability. In anticipation of slower growth of sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major trading partners. A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the staff continued to build a considerable degree of fiscal restraint into its forecast. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some further easing of pressures on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent trends.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the information available since the August meeting had tended to confirm earlier indications of a pickup in the expansion after a period of sluggish growth during the spring. The economy did not display uniform strength across industries or regions, but it appeared on balance to have considerable and desirable expansionary momentum. Growth at a pace averaging close to, or perhaps slightly below, the economy's potential was viewed as the most likely prospect for the year ahead. The outlook for economic activity remained subject to a variety of uncertainties, including the still unsettled course of the federal budget, and many members saw the risks of a shortfall from expectations as slightly greater than those of significantly faster growth. With regard to inflation, the slower increases in key measures of consumer and producer prices since earlier in the year were a welcome development, and a number of members commented that inflation was likely to remain contained, given likely developments. Many expressed concern, however, that significant further progress toward achieving stable prices might not be made over the next year or two.  In keeping with indicators of nationwide economic performance, anecdotal and other reports on regional activity suggested somewhat uneven business conditions in different parts of the country, but collectively the reports pointed to moderate overall growth. Business activity in most regions had tended to improve or to remain firm during the summer months, though declining growth or very sluggish activity characterized some areas. The level of business confidence generally appeared to have stayed high, but several members indicated that they sensed from their contacts that business expectations were somewhat fragile and vulnerable to adverse developments.  In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members generally viewed comparatively moderate growth in consumer spending as a likely prospect over the forecast period. After recording sizable gains in late spring, retail sales had been well maintained in recent months, with some strengthening in the motor vehicles sector in August apparently carrying over to September. Favorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included the increases that had occurred in the value of financial assets and the demand for household appliances and other durables that was expected to be generated by stronger housing activity. On the other hand, overall gains in consumer spending were likely to be restrained by cyclically waning pent-up demands for consumer durables, especially motor vehicles; still widespread concerns about job security associated with ongoing business restructuring and downsizing activities; and higher consumer debt loads.  Housing demand was continuing to respond to more attractive mortgage rates, as evidenced by nationwide data and anecdotal reports from many parts of the country. Increases in construction activity were lagging the improvement in housing demand and had been limited thus far, but considerable strength in homebuilding activity could be expected over the next several months. The extent of further lagged responses to reduced mortgage rates could not be foreseen with any degree of certainty, and in any event housing demand would depend on broad economic developments such as trends in employment and income. Housing activity appeared to have weakened over recent months in one major market where economic conditions were described as relatively sluggish. In many other areas, however, persons in the real estate industry were reported to be optimistic about the outlook for housing.  Business fixed investment remained a strongly positive factor in the economy and was expected to provide further impetus to growth over the next several quarters. The contribution of this sector could be expected to lessen, however, as capital spending was adjusted to expectations of a maturing expansion characterized by the emergence of slower growth in final demand and business profits. In particular, the outsized growth in business spending for equipment did not appear to be sustainable under foreseeable economic conditions.  Diminished growth in inventories still seemed to be retarding the expansion in overall business activity, as evidenced in part by continuing reports of efforts by various business firms to bring their inventories into better balance with sales. Nonetheless, such adjustments now appeared to have been largely completed, or were expected to be completed over the months immediately ahead, so that inventory investment could be expected to have little effect on the course of the economy during 1996. It was noted, however, that projections of inventory behavior were subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  A number of members commented that fiscal policy developments constituted a major uncertainty in the outlook for economic activity. While measures incorporating substantial reductions in spending from current trends were widely expected to be enacted into law, it was not possible to predict the outcome of the continuing debate on the federal budget in the Congress and the Administration. Further complicating any efforts to assess the potential damping influence of prospective fiscal policy were uncertainties regarding the time frame during which the new expenditure and tax measures would be put in place--including the extent to which they would be implemented over the year ahead--and the effects of the new fiscal measures on economic incentives and financial markets. Favorable business and financial market reactions would tend to mitigate, at least for a time, the restraining effects of fiscal measures on aggregate demand. On the other hand, if the deficit reduction measures that eventually were enacted were to fall substantially short of current expectations, there would be adverse repercussions in financial markets and possibly on business confidence.  The nation's trade deficit was expected to diminish somewhat over the next several quarters and in the process to exert less restraint on domestic economic activity. The better trade performance was projected to result from a number of factors, including the improved competitive position of U.S. producers and the lagged effects of earlier declines in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. It also was associated with forecasts of somewhat stronger growth in economic activity abroad than in the United States. While there were continuing anecdotal reports of expanding export markets, some members expressed reservations about the extent to which the economies of major foreign trading partners would strengthen over the forecast period and the related prospects for growth of foreign demand for U.S. goods and services.  Views on the outlook for inflation centered on forecasts of little change or some slight decline in the rate of increase in consumer prices over the year ahead. The appreciable moderation in inflation in recent months had checked the deteriorating trend that seemed to be emerging during the early months of the year, but the members generally believed that recent developments did not point to a significant further decline in inflation. Pressures on producer resources had eased since the early part of the year, but the labor market remained tight and capacity utilization was still above its historical average. In this connection, a few members commented that current forecasts were subject to a range of error that included a risk of some intensification of inflationary pressures.  One uncertainty bearing on the outlook for inflation was the extent to which potentially greater pressures on labor costs would be translated into higher prices. Increases in labor expenses had been held down by markedly reduced advances in the costs of benefits, notably medical benefits. The economies from the latter source might well lessen over coming quarters as the most easily implemented reductions in the costs of providing medical care were achieved. Moreover, the rise in worker compensation had been unusually restrained in recent years in relation to the strong demand for workers, evidently reflecting the effects of worker concerns about job security in a period of business restructurings and downsizings, but continued strength in the demand for labor might be expected to induce more rapid increases in labor compensation over time. Some members commented, however, that the underlying factors affecting employment costs were not likely to change greatly over the forecast period. In addition, the prospect that intense competitive pressures would persist in many markets under projected economic conditions suggested that business firms would continue to find it very difficult to pass on rising costs through higher prices. It also was possible that the rates of capacity utilization and employment associated with a steady rate of inflation had changed in the direction of providing the economy greater leeway to operate at a somewhat higher level without generating more inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions. The expansion seemed for now to have a desirable and sustainable momentum that did not call for any change in policy. Furthermore, the outlook remained clouded by the uncertainties stemming from the ongoing federal budget debate. In any event, the Committee would need to remain alert to a broader range of developments that might warrant a policy change at some point. In this connection, several members expressed the opinion that policy might have to be eased eventually in light of the downside risks that they saw in the economy and a current policy stance that they viewed as slightly restrictive. However, the current performance of the economy suggested that the timing of an easing action was not an immediate concern. Other members who preferred an unchanged policy placed more emphasis on current forecasts of little or no progress in reducing inflation from recent levels. They thought it would be premature to ease policy without greater assurance that inflation had been contained in the current cyclical expansion and that prospects for significant further progress toward the long-run objective of price level stability had improved. Indeed, the direction of the next policy move was not clear in the view of some members, and they believed that any easing should await a firm indication that the outlook for economic activity was becoming less favorable or that inflation was decreasing more rapidly than expected.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, the members all endorsed a proposal to retain an intermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any bias concerning the direction of possible intermeeting policy changes. At this juncture, there was no specific reason to anticipate developments that would call for an adjustment to policy during the weeks ahead. While a change in policy certainly could not be ruled out, the reasons for the change likely would involve sensitive issues that would warrant Committee consultation regardless of the intermeeting instruction.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated a preference for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year at a pace near that experienced in recent months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate rate in the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in August after essentially no growth in July; the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production posted a large increase in August to a level moderately above the average of the second quarter. Total nominal retail sales rose slightly on balance over July and August after registering appreciable gains in the prior two months. Housing starts were up a little in August after increasing sharply in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods have softened but still point to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment over coming months; nonresidential construction has been strong of late. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened slightly in July from its average rate in the second quarter. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in recent months.  Market interest rates have fallen somewhat since the Committee meeting on August 22. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined over the intermeeting period, with most of the decline occurring over the past several days.  M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases in August but growth of those aggregates appears to have moderated somewhat in September. For the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate appreciably above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year near the pace of recent months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information available at the time of the meeting was mixed, but on balance it suggested a more moderate rate of expansion of economic activity after a strong gain during the summer. Consumer spending had turned sluggish recently; but with order backlogs still large, business spending for durable equipment was continuing at a robust if somewhat less rapid rate, and the sizable rise in housing starts in the third quarter presaged higher residential construction outlays. Appreciable increases in employment and hours worked tended to confirm that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace, although manufacturing activity had weakened a little. Consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly on average in recent months after having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the year, and growth in labor costs had slowed further.  Nonfarm payroll employment, though held down somewhat by the onset of a labor strike in the aircraft industry, increased in October at the average monthly pace of the third quarter; in addition, aggregate hours worked by private production workers rose appreciably further. Construction payrolls recorded another sizable advance. The rate of job growth in the services industry slowed a little further, reflecting a decline in employment in personnel supply services after two months of strong advances. Manufacturing employment declined again. The civilian unemployment rate edged down in October to 5.5 percent.  Industrial production fell somewhat in October after having risen appreciably in the third quarter; most of the loss reflected the strike in the aircraft industry, but motor vehicle production and mining output also recorded substantial declines. In contrast, production of information processing equipment continued to rise at a rapid pace. Total utilization of industrial capacity contracted in October, with declines widespread across industries.  Total nominal retail sales, which had expanded relatively briskly over the second and third quarters, fell in October. As part of a pattern of widespread weakness in October, purchases at furniture and appliance stores were down appreciably after large gains in earlier months, and sales at general merchandise and apparel outlets reversed most of their sizable September increases. Housing demand and construction activity firmed in the third quarter: Sales of both new and existing homes posted solid advances, and single-family housing starts rose considerably, though multifamily starts remained sluggish.  Business investment in both equipment and structures expanded less rapidly in the third quarter. Stepped-up shipments of nondefense capital goods in August and September more than offset a sharp drop in shipments in July, but the quarterly average gain was significantly smaller than the increases recorded in the previous two quarters. Although orders for nondefense capital goods also rose more slowly in the third quarter, the still-sizable order backlogs pointed to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near term. Nonresidential construction increased appreciably further in the third quarter, reflecting a surge in office and institutional building activity.  Available data suggested a reduction in business inventory accumulation in August and September. In manufacturing, the pace of stockbuilding slowed in the third quarter from the brisk rate of the first half of the year, leaving the factory stock-shipments ratio unchanged in the third quarter and a little above historic lows. In the wholesale sector, inventories were drawn down in August and September after sizable buildups in earlier months; with sales weak, the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in the third quarter and was at the upper end of its range for recent years. Retail inventories expanded significantly in August (latest data available), but the stockbuilding was generally in line with sales and the ratio of inventories to sales remained near the middle of its range in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed markedly in August; for July and August-combined, the deficit was significantly smaller than its average rate in the second quarter. The value of exports declined over the two-month period, with increases in exports of computers and agricultural products more than offset by decreases in exports of aircraft, gold, and service receipts. Imports fell more than exports; with the notable exception of computers and semiconductors, declines were recorded in most major import categories. Available data indicated that economic expansion remained subdued in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth continued to slow in the European economies other than Italy, and the Japanese economy showed little evidence of a sustained recovery.  Consumer prices rose at a slightly faster rate in October; with a smaller increase in food prices offsetting higher energy prices, the index for items other than food and energy also picked up a little. For the four months ending in October, prices for nonfood, non-energy items advanced at a rate well below that of earlier in the year. Producer prices of finished goods edged down in October, reflecting a further decline in the prices of finished energy goods. Excluding food and energy, producer prices were unchanged in October and increased at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the first half of the year. Growth in total nominal hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed in the third quarter and, on a year-over-year basis, continued to trend down: the decrease in compensation growth over the past year spanned most major occupations and industries.  At its meeting on September 26, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the year at a pace near that experienced in recent months.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-3/4 percent, apart from a temporary rise around the end of the third quarter. Other short-term market rates also changed little on balance; market participants continued to anticipate an easing of monetary policy at some point but apparently viewed the chances of near-term easing as small. Longer-term interest rates declined further over the intermeeting period, perhaps in response to a growing conviction that inflation pressures would remain subdued and that substantial reductions in fiscal deficits would be achieved over a period of years. The lower longer-term interest rates, coupled with continuing reports of strong corporate earnings, helped lift major indexes of equity prices to new record levels during the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the intermeeting period.  Expansion of the broad monetary aggregates weakened in October. M2 was unchanged in October after having grown relatively rapidly in the third quarter and despite the persistence of low opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets. For the year through October, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's range for this aggregate in 1995. Growth of M3 apparently was held down somewhat by the reduced need for additional bank funding during a time of sluggish loan demand; for the year to date, M3 grew at a rate a little above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had risen more slowly in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion of both private and federal borrowing. Nonetheless, for the year to date, this measure of debt remained around the midpoint of its monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity would slow from the strong third-quarter pace to a rate more in line with the increase in the economy's potential. The forecast assumed that the favorable interest-rate and wealth effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets would provide support for a moderate advance in final sales. Consumer spending was expected to expand at a rate generally in line with the growth of incomes; the favorable effects of higher prices on financial assets held by households would be offset to some extent by the difficulties of increasing numbers of households in servicing their growing debts. The greater affordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. In anticipation of reduced growth in sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow appreciably from the very rapid pace of the past few years. Strong export expansion would be associated with the improving outlook for the economies of major trading partners. Although substantial uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate a considerable degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, wage and price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent levels.  In the Committee's discussion, members commented that recent statistical and anecdotal information pointed on balance to an appreciable slowing in the economic expansion, which had displayed unexpected strength during the summer months. There was some mix of views among the members concerning how far the slowing might proceed, though they generally viewed moderate growth as the most likely course for the economy. A number of members believed that growth around potential was a probable outcome, with business activity sustained in part by the favorable developments this year in the bond and stock markets. Other members expressed concern about some signs of further ebbing in the strength of final demands, and they envisaged the possible need for a policy adjustment at some point to sustain continued moderate growth. With regard to inflation, members noted that despite generally high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets in many parts of the country, inflation had been more subdued than many had expected over the past several months. A number of members commented that they saw a basis in this development for mild optimism about the outlook for inflation, but others expressed concern that, in the context of current forecasts for economic activity and relatively high levels of resource use, progress toward lower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed there was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported on uneven business conditions in different parts of the country and among industries. On balance, modest to moderate growth appeared to characterize most regions, with overall levels of activity ranging from relatively robust in some regions to comparatively depressed in others. The mixed conditions were especially notable in manufacturing where numerous producers faced lagging demands while others, particularly in high-tech industries, found it difficult to satisfy strong demands for their products. More generally, the industrial sector of the economy had tended to stagnate for some time, including a slight decline in manufacturing activity reported for October, but recent improvement in orders for steel was cited as a favorable if not decisive omen in the outlook for industrial production. In other sectors of the economy, members observed that tourism displayed considerable strength in many areas, while cattle operations and energy production were adversely affected by high production costs or low prices.  In their review of developments in key demand sectors of the economy, members observed that consumer spending appeared to be on a firm growth trend, though weakness in overall sales of motor vehicles in recent months and a decline in total retail sales in October had introduced a cautionary note. It was suggested that the performance of retail sales during the holiday season would tend to set the tone for the longer-term trend in such sales, and in this respect available data and anecdotal reports covering the first part of November were somewhat promising. More generally, further growth in consumer spending, though probably at a somewhat slower pace than over the past year, appeared likely. Such growth would be supported by moderate expansion in incomes and by the favorable effects on household wealth and confidence of the substantial improvement in the value of financial assets this year and the ready availability of financing on relatively attractive terms. Consumer confidence currently seemed to be at a fairly high level, albeit not uniformly so across the country, and at least for the quarters immediately ahead, anticipated strength in homebuilding should induce spending for many household durables. On the negative side, some members emphasized that the growth in consumer debt was likely to exert an increasingly inhibiting effect on consumer spending. Moreover, the satisfaction of earlier pent-up demands might well limit sales of many consumer durables, notably motor vehicles, in coming quarters. In one view, the projected growth in personal incomes and the increases that had occurred this year in the value of household holdings of financial assets would provide relatively little stimulus to consumer spending because the distribution of such gains was heavily tilted toward consumers in higher income or older age groups.  Further sizable growth in business fixed investment, but at a pace well below that experienced in recent years, was expected to provide appreciable impetus to the expansion over the next several quarters. Favorable factors in the outlook for business capital spending included a desire to upgrade technological capabilities for competitive reasons, strong business earnings and cash flows, and an ample availability of financing on relatively liberal terms. Declining office vacancy rates in a number of areas would help to support office construction, and several members also commented on the strength in commercial and other nonresidential building activity in various parts of the country.  Ongoing efforts by many business firms to bring inventories into better alignment with sales had resulted in declining inventory investment since earlier in the year. Some further inventory adjustments, notably in stocks of motor vehicles, were expected over coming months, though not at a pace that would have a marked retarding effect on economic activity. Over much of 1996, inventory investment was projected to be a more neutral factor in the economy, with accumulation proceeding at a pace in line with growth in final sales, but the risks of unexpected developments in this sector of the economy were always substantial.  The outlook for fiscal policy remained obscured by the uncertain outcome of the current debate between the Congress and the Administration. While substantial fiscal restraint aimed at eventually balancing the budget appeared to be the likely result, the timing of the implementation of various tax and expenditure initiatives and the resulting extent of the fiscal restraint over the forecast period could not be anticipated with any degree of precision. For the nearer term, the ongoing shutdown of much of the federal government presented a downside risk to the expansion whose effects would depend on the presently uncertain duration of the shutdown and the potential unsettlement in financial markets that might develop at some point. The members generally believed, however, that in light of the underlying strength of the economy, the retarding effects of likely federal budget developments would not be sufficient in themselves to arrest the expansion over the forecast period, at least if the federal government shutdown were of relatively short duration and a federal debt default were averted.  The nation's foreign trade deficit had worsened substantially during the past several years, but current forecasts did not point to further deterioration over the projection period. An anticipated firming in the economies of major U.S. trading partners was expected to bolster exports. Several members questioned, however, the extent to which forecasts of strengthening economic activity were likely to materialize in a number of these countries, and they suggested that the foreign sector might well remain a somewhat constraining factor in the performance of the domestic economy.  Members welcomed the generally favorable price and cost developments of recent months and the related indications that currently high levels of resource use did not appear to be associated with rising inflationary pressures. Many emphasized the persistence of subdued increases in labor costs, and a number provided supporting anecdotal indications of relatively small advances in labor compensation in many parts of the country despite tight labor markets. The anecdotal reports also continued to suggest that strong competition was holding down price inflation and that producers were benefiting from soft prices of industrial materials. While a number of members believed that these developments might augur a modest decline in inflation over the year ahead, given current forecasts of moderate economic expansion, many viewed as more likely the prospect of little or no progress toward price stability over coming quarters and some expressed concern about the potential for an upward drift in the rate of inflation. An underlying factor in the relatively favorable climate for inflation was the continued limited rise in the costs of worker benefits. In the view of some members, however, benefit costs were likely to be less well contained as time went on and further major gains in curbing such costs became more difficult to achieve. Moreover, worker willingness to accept relatively limited increases in wages and other compensation might well begin to erode as concerns about job security tended to diminish after an extended period of relatively low unemployment. On balance, recent experience had raised questions about the relationship between levels of resource use and inflation that warranted careful monitoring.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one member favored or could accept an unchanged policy stance. This policy position took account of current indications of a generally acceptable rate of economic growth and the absence of any clear signs regarding the future strength of the expansion in relation to the economy's potential or the future course of inflation. Several commented that current monetary policy might be viewed as somewhat restrictive, though the degree of restraint was difficult to calibrate and it did not appear as yet to be inhibiting declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, increases in stock prices, or the availability of financing from lending institutions.  Members expressed somewhat differing views regarding the stance of monetary policy that was likely to prove consistent with the Committee's objectives over time. In the view of some, private spending was not likely to have sufficient momentum to overcome the effects of increased fiscal restraint if the current stance of monetary policy were maintained. In the circumstances, an easing at some point would be needed to foster sustained economic growth at an acceptable pace and would be consistent with progress toward the System's price stability objective. For most of these members, however, the stronger-than-expected performance of the economy in the third quarter had reduced the urgency of such a policy move and had created enough uncertainties to justify a careful appraisal of unfolding developments before a decision was made to ease policy. In the view of one member, the probability of a shortfall from an acceptable rate of economic expansion was sufficiently high to require an immediate easing of policy. Other members believed that an unchanged policy was desirable under current conditions and that the direction and timing of the next policy move was more open to question. Not only were recent data giving an uncertain picture of the underlying strength of aggregate demand, but current forecasts generally did not point to progress toward the System's long-run goal of price stability. In this view, therefore, the current stance of monetary policy, even if slightly restrictive, was likely to be consistent with satisfactory economic growth over time and it would provide better assurance of consolidating gains against inflation and fostering some further moderation in price increases over coming years. With regard to potential fiscal policy developments, although an especially broad range of outcomes seemed possible, the members agreed that the Committee could not freeze its policy options while it awaited the outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate nor could it commit itself to a specific response to a particular fiscal policy agreement. Fiscal policy and any associated market reactions would be among the many factors that would have to be taken into account in the formulation of monetary policy.  In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to monetary policy, a majority of the members expressed a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. In their view, the potential need to adjust policy during the relatively short intermeeting period was remote and some of these members also believed that the direction of the next adjustment to policy was uncertain. A few also noted that the adoption of a biased intermeeting instruction at this point might send an unintended message regarding the prevailing view within the Committee concerning the risks to the expansion. The remaining members said that they preferred a directive that was tilted toward an easing policy action. Such an instruction in the directive would be consistent with what they viewed as the most likely policy course over coming months. They agreed, however, that the current uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook were not likely to be resolved during the weeks immediately ahead and since no policy action was likely to be required in this period, they could accept a symmetric directive.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they could vote for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a moderation in the expansion of economic activity after a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in October and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.5 percent. Industrial production fell somewhat in October after a moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal retail sales were little changed on balance over September and October. Single-family housing starts were up considerably in the third quarter. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near term; nonresidential construction has risen appreciably further. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed over July and August from its average rate in the second quarter. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly on average in recent months.  Short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance since the Committee meeting on September 26 while long-term rates have fallen somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined slightly over the intermeeting period.  In October, M2 was unchanged and M3 growth moderated. For the year through October, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate a little above its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in recent months but for the year to date remains around the midpoint of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

Mr. Lindsey dissented because he believed that monetary policy should be eased. The evidence suggested to him that in the absence of an easing move the underlying rate of nominal GDP growth was likely to be lower than needed to maintain real GDP at or near its potential. The intermediate forecast was subject to a number of significant risks: household balance sheets seemed unlikely to sustain the current rate of durables expenditure for any extended period; government expenditures were certain to be cut substantially; and with fiscal contractions underway in Europe and Canada and severe financial stresses present in Japan and Mexico, he did not see much likelihood of a substantial expansion of exports. In keeping with his views, the financial markets were signalling the likelihood that a weaker pace of nominal GDP growth would materialize. The yield curve was virtually flat, with government securities up through relatively long maturities trading at yields below the current average federal funds rate. Thus, markets would be unlikely to find some easing inappropriate and over the intermediate horizon would view the current level of short-term rates as unsustainable.",199511,0,344,1995-11-30,-0.06,-0.14,0.1,0.02,-0.08,-0.07,-0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1995-11-15

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information available at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed substantially after a strong gain in such activity during the third quarter. Data on employment and aggregate hours worked since late summer were consistent with moderate further increases in overall economic activity. Industrial production had changed little on balance after a sizable rise in the third quarter. On the spending side, robust advances in business fixed investment continued to provide considerable impetus to the economy. The available information on consumer expenditures pointed to somewhat reduced gains in recent months, and indicators of housing demand suggested on balance that activity in housing markets had tended to stabilize after several months of considerable strengthening. Consumer prices had risen relatively slowly in recent months, while increases in labor compensation had remained comparatively subdued.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to grow at a pace roughly in line with the expansion of the labor force in recent months, with gains concentrated in the private service-producing sectors. The published information indicated some further declines in factory and government jobs in October and November. Although aggregate hours of private production workers fell in November, they remained appreciably above their average level in the third quarter. The unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent in November, equaling its average for the third quarter.  Industrial production was little changed on balance over October and November after a sizable increase in the third quarter. A decline in October was largely accounted for by a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer and that strike, very recently settled, had also exerted a slightly depressing effect on production in November. Production of motor vehicles and parts also fell, on net, in October and November. Further growth outside the aircraft and motor vehicle industries was paced by continuing strength in the production of business equipment. Outside manufacturing, the output of utilities was boosted in November by demand associated with unusually cold weather.  Business fixed investment was continuing to grow at a rapid pace, with much of the strength stemming from the persisting and vigorous expansion in spending for office and computing equipment. However, the recent gains in total business investment had moderated from the extraordinary pace evident in 1994 and early 1995, and they also were less widespread among major categories of business equipment than they had been earlier. New orders for nondefense capital goods other than computers and aircraft had leveled out, although shipments were being maintained at high levels by still-large backlogs of unfilled orders. Producers of aircraft had received very sizable new orders recently, but shipments of completed aircraft had been held back in recent months by the strike at a major firm. Outlays for nonresidential construction were continuing to advance briskly, with construction of commercial structures posting sizable increases recently. Overall drilling and mining activity also had continued to move higher, led by increased exploration for natural gas.  Total nominal retail sales rose considerably in November, more than offsetting a drop in October; over the two months, retail sales were advancing at a slower pace than the average rate in the second and third quarters. Much of the November increase reflected strong gains in sales of consumer durables, including improved sales of motor vehicles. In the nondurables sector, a sizable rise in November about reversed a decline in October. Recent surveys of consumer sentiment pointed to generally positive attitudes.  After having recorded robust advances during the third quarter, most indicators of housing activity suggested little further change more recently. However, considerable strength in mortgage applications associated with lower mortgage rates, together with survey indications of an upturn in house-buying intentions, pointed to strengthening housing construction over coming months. Housing starts were down in October, the latest month for which these data were available, after a large increase in the third quarter.  Data for October indicated a sizable accumulation of business inventories. In manufacturing, stocks grew at a rate only moderately below the brisk pace in the third quarter, and the rise continued to be concentrated in the capital goods industries. The aggregate ratio of inventories to sales in manufacturing was somewhat above the lows in late 1994 and early 1995. In the wholesale sector, a buildup in stocks of capital equipment accounted for the bulk of the accumulation in October, and the inventory-to-sales ratio in this sector remained on an uptrend. A sharp rise in retail inventories in October was led by a large increase in stocks at auto dealers and at general merchandise and apparel outlets. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was at its high for the year, but signs of overstocking, apart from motor vehicles, were limited.  After having strengthened appreciably in the third quarter, federal government purchases were now lagging and exerting some retarding effect on overall economic activity. The decline in federal purchases in part represented the transitory effects of government shutdowns and the restraining effects of spending cuts imposed by continuing resolutions and by curtailed appropriations in bills that already had been enacted into law. At the state and local government levels, however, available data pointed to continued, relatively strong growth in purchases.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services changed little in September (latest data available). Measured on a quarterly average basis, however, the deficit declined substantially in the third quarter, with the reduction about equally divided between a rise in the value of exports and a drop in the value of imports. Increases in exports were widespread among the major categories of trade, while reductions in imports were concentrated in categories in which there had been large gains in the second quarter. Available data pointed to subdued growth in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the second half of 1995.  Consumer prices had risen more slowly on balance in recent months than they had during the first half of the year. In November, the total index for consumer prices was unchanged, and consumer prices excluding food and energy were up only slightly. In contrast, producer prices of finished goods registered a relatively large increase in November, and the component of this index excluding food and energy posted its largest rise since January. At the same time, prices of intermediate materials declined a bit further in November. According to recent survey results, consumers now expected less inflation over the year ahead and also over the next five to ten years. The available data on wages and worker benefits continued on balance to display a relatively subdued trend of increases in labor compensation.  At its meeting on November 15, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a bit above the expected rate of 5-3/4 percent over the period. The bunching of settlements of several Treasury issues that had resulted from debt ceiling disruptions and the mid-December corporate tax date were among the factors exerting pressure on the funds rate. Most other short-term interest rates fell slightly and longer-term interest rates extended earlier declines during the intermeeting period. Market expectations of some easing of monetary policy appeared to be reinforced by market interpretations of the incoming information as further evidence that overall demand would be restrained and that the risks of a pickup in inflationary pressures had diminished. Over the intermeeting interval, major indexes of stock prices continued to move higher in concert with the rise in bond prices.  The sluggish performance of the broad monetary aggregates since August continued in November. Despite the persistence of low opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets, M2 growth was relatively modest in November after a slight contraction in October. M3 growth slowed further in November, partly as a result of a shift of funding by borrowers toward capital market instruments to take advantage of lower long-term market rates. Nonetheless, because of robust expansion earlier in the year, M2 remained in the upper half of its 1995 range through November and M3 expanded at a rate at the upper end of its range. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had slowed somewhat in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion of both private and federal borrowing, and for 1995 to date, this debt measure had grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly further on balance over the intermeeting period. Declining interest rates in several major foreign industrial countries, evidently induced by disappointing economic growth in those countries, appeared to have a firming effect on the dollar in relation to European currencies. The dollar changed little against the Japanese yen over the period after a sharp advance earlier. The Mexican peso appreciated a bit in relation to the dollar over the period.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity would slow substantially from the very strong pace now indicated for the third quarter. Although this forecast did not differ significantly from that prepared for the November meeting, less growth than expected earlier seemed likely in the current quarter. Over the forecast horizon, however, the economy was still projected to expand at a pace that would keep activity close to the economy's potential. The forecast anticipated that the expansion in consumer spending would slow a bit in response to diminished gains in disposable income associated with less-rapid advances in spending in other sectors of the economy. The rise that had occurred in the value of financial assets held by households would be a positive factor helping to support consumer spending but one that would be offset to a degree by the difficulties of an increasing number of households in servicing their growing debts. The greater affordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. In the context of reduced growth in sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to increase more moderately after several years of rapid advance. Although indications of excess inventories were limited, slower growth in sales and ongoing efforts to reduce inventory costs were projected to lead to smaller increases in stocks over the projection period. Exports were expected to be bolstered to some extent by the projected improvement in the economies of major trading partners. Although a great deal of uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate an appreciable degree of fiscal restraint. Given the projected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources would remain relatively high, and the underlying trend of price inflation was seen as unlikely to change significantly over the projection period.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members noted that the information that had become available since the November meeting tended to confirm earlier indications that the economic expansion had slowed appreciably from the brisk pace of the summer months. The members generally agreed that the most likely course for the economy remained one of moderate growth. Expansion at or near potential was seen as the most probable outcome, associated at least in part with the favorable effects on business and consumer spending of lower interest rates, higher equity prices, and an ample availability of credit. However, a number of members expressed concern that the strength of final demands would not be sufficient to support growth near the economy's potential, absent a policy adjustment. One factor that might retard growth was a higher level of real short-term interest rates owing to the favorable performance of inflation. Members noted that consumer price increases had remained relatively subdued and below expectations in recent months, despite the generally high levels of utilization of both labor and capital resources that had prevailed through much of the year. Several commented that the effects of new technologies, gains in productivity, global competitive pressures on businesses, and restraint in wage setting might imply that inflation would edge down further. Others expressed concern that the prospects for further reductions in inflation seemed quite limited in the context of projected high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets in many parts of the country.  In the Committee's discussion of regional developments, members reported that anecdotal and other information pertaining to regional activity suggested that the moderation in nationwide economic growth was evident across most of the nation, with the rate of expansion ranging from slow to moderate in different areas of the country. Overall levels of business activity continued to vary widely, from relatively weak in some areas to comparatively robust in others. Conditions also were uneven across industries, particularly in manufacturing, where flagging auto sales and some further inventory accumulation contrasted sharply with brisk demand for a range of producers durable goods, notably office and computing equipment, and building products. Despite indications that job growth had been relatively limited, labor markets remained tight in many parts of the country and there were more, albeit still limited, reports of rising wage pressures; in some areas, however, labor market conditions appeared to have eased somewhat recently.  In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members commented that the data and the anecdotal information on consumer spending had been mixed. For the holiday season, reports indicated that retail sales had been disappointing thus far, though sales appeared to be holding up relatively well in some sections of the country and for higher-priced luxury items more generally. Consumers had remained very cautious despite considerable promotional sales activity, perhaps anticipating even more aggressive markdowns of prices as the shopping season neared its end. Members noted that the reluctance of consumers also might be reflecting a sense of continued job insecurity in an environment of ongoing business restructuring and downsizing, higher debt service burdens and rising delinquency rates, and the satisfaction of pent-up demand for durable goods. While these factors might be exerting an inhibiting influence on consumers, the members generally viewed moderate growth in consumer spending as a reasonable expectation in the context of further projected expansion in disposable incomes. The increase in household wealth associated with the strong performance of the bond and stock markets might tend to boost consumer spending relative to disposable incomes, although one member suggested that the highly concentrated nature of wealth holdings might limit any positive effect on aggregate consumption. With regard to housing, members took note of the recent declines in single-family housing starts and sales after a strong third quarter. They remarked, however, that some of their contacts were anticipating that the declines in mortgage interest rates over recent months to their current relatively low levels would foster a wave of mortgage refinancing and a pickup in housing demand in the spring.  Business fixed investment was expected to grow at a pace appreciably less than that observed in recent years but nonetheless to continue supplying considerable impetus to the expansion. Strong profits and cash flows, along with the ample availability of financing on attractive terms, were favorable factors in the outlook; on the other hand, a weakening trend in final demand, notably in consumer outlays, likely would have a negative effect on business capital spending. Several members reported that commercial and other nonresidential construction activity remained brisk in various regions around the nation. A number of members commented on business inventory developments. Overall inventories of motor vehicles were on the high side, and inventory accumulation more generally appeared to be running somewhat ahead of sales. There were no indications that serious overhangs were emerging, but there were risks that efforts to hold down stocks would damp production over the near term.  The outlook for fiscal policy continued to be clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the debate between the Congress and the Administration. The members anticipated that the result of the debate would be considerable fiscal restraint, but the timing of tax and spending initiatives aimed at an eventual balancing of the budget and the extent of the fiscal contraction over time could not be forecast with any precision. In the interim, much of the federal government was closed, and while federal workers were expected to get paid eventually, their spending and that of federal contractors might be damped until the situation was resolved. The members believed, however, that in light of the plans being put forward, the fiscal drag imposed by likely federal budget developments would not be unusually large over the next few years.  In reviewing the outlook for inflation, members referred to the generally favorable price and cost experience of recent months. Several pointed to subdued increases in labor compensation and to anecdotal indications that upward pressures on wages and benefits remained scattered despite tightness in many labor markets. In this environment, and with the economy expected to expand at a comparatively moderate pace over the forecast period, many members anticipated that inflation would remain relatively stable despite continuing high levels of resource utilization, and some believed that it might record a somewhat improved performance. One argument advanced in support of a possibly better performance was that the recent experience, which had been more favorable than expected given capacity utilization levels, was perhaps suggestive of the effects of rapid technological improvements on productivity, the enhanced efficiencies from greater economic specialization around the world, and the influence of heightened job insecurity on wages and prices. Another was the possible effect on future wage demands of the lower inflation expectations that now prevailed. Although no member saw greater inflation as having a high probability, several did refer to risks in that direction, including the possibility of greater pressures on resources stemming from faster than currently anticipated economic growth.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members either favored or could accept a slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions. One argument cited in favor of some easing was that the policy stance, as indexed by the prevailing real federal funds rate, was becoming somewhat restrictive as inflation and inflationary expectations moderated, leaving real short-term rates higher than anticipated. In addition, with markets expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate in coming months, an unchanged policy was likely to lead to a backup in intermediate- and long-term rates. Although there was no sign that a cumulative deterioration in economic performance was about to get under way, the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have increased and a modest easing would better position policy to guard against the possibility that over the longer term the expansion would begin to fall short of the economy's potential, especially with fiscal policy likely to be at least moderately restrictive. In any case, the recent slowing of the economic expansion, combined with the wage and price restraint evident at current levels of resource utilization and continuing business efforts to expand capacity, suggested that there was little risk of a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the favorable inflation experience over the last half year raised the possibility of continued modest price improvement.  A number of members, though willing to accept a slight easing, preferred an unchanged policy stance. While inflation had slowed from the elevated pace observed in the early part of the year, there was little hard evidence to indicate that it would decline any further over the forecast horizon or that there had been a significant increase in the sustainable growth rate of the economy. A few members also expressed concern about the possible repercussions in financial markets of an easing action that would follow an already strong rally in bond and stock prices. In the circumstances, these members questioned whether a somewhat easier policy stance would prove consistent with the Committee's objective of fostering further progress toward price stability. Moreover, although the available evidence on the economy's current performance remained mixed, the moderation in economic growth after the third-quarter surge did not seem at this time to signal a growing shortfall of the economy from its potential. Instead, the economy was likely in this view to continue to grow at a generally acceptable rate at or near capacity, and a few members saw some potential for somewhat faster growth at a pace that over time could intensify inflationary pressures. Accordingly, they preferred to wait for further evidence on inflation trends and the performance of the economy, but they indicated that in light of the uncertainties that were involved and the small amount of easing that was proposed they would not dissent from the majority position.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain an intermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any presumption about the direction of a possible intermeeting change. While such a change in policy could not be ruled out, the potential need for a further intermeeting policy adjustment appeared remote at this juncture. The risks to the outlook seemed generally in balance, and the direction of the next policy move was not clear in the view of some members.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they favored or could support a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve conditions during the intermeeting period but that contained no presumption about the likely direction of any intermeeting policy change. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. A staff analysis indicated that the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a substantial slowing in the expansion of economic activity after a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in November, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent. Industrial production was little changed on average over October and November after a moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal retail sales rose somewhat on balance over October and November. Housing starts were down in October after a large increase in the third quarter. However, orders for nondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near term, and nonresidential construction has risen appreciably further. Wage trends have been stable and consumer prices have risen relatively slowly on average in recent months.  Most market interest rates have declined slightly since the Committee meeting on November 15. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.  The substantial moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 since midsummer continued in November; however, for the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate at the upper end of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in recent months but for the year to date remains around the midpoint of its monitoring range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Only a limited amount of new information was available for this meeting because of delays in government releases; that which was available, along with anecdotal commentary, suggested that the economy had been growing relatively slowly in recent months. Consumer spending had expanded modestly on balance, growth in business investment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently, and housing demand seemed to have leveled out. Slower growth in final sales was leading to inventory buildups in a few industries and these buildups, together with the disruptions from government shutdowns and severe weather, were having a restraining effect on economic activity. The demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace, though, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low. The recent data on prices and wages had been mixed, but there was no firm evidence of a change in underlying inflation trends.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in December; the gain was in line with the average monthly increase for 1995. Employment in manufacturing, boosted by the settlement of a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer, reversed the declines of October and November. Construction payrolls rose further in December, despite unfavorable weather in some parts of the country. Job growth remained solid in much of the services industry, although employment at personnel supply firms was little changed. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent in December.  Industrial production edged up in December and for the fourth quarter as a whole advanced only slightly; industrial activity remained sluggish in January according to the limited statistical information that was available. In December, manufacturing output rose a bit in association with an increase in motor vehicle assemblies and aircraft production. Elsewhere in manufacturing, the growth of output of office and computing equipment slowed somewhat from the rapid pace of previous months, and the production of defense and space equipment and of nondurable consumer goods registered sizable declines. The output of utilities was boosted somewhat in December by the effect of colder-than-average temperatures on the demand for heating services. Utilization of total industrial capacity fell slightly but remained at a moderately elevated level.  Retail sales continued to grow at a relatively modest rate in December, and the fourth-quarter increase was considerably smaller than those of the previous two quarters. In the fourth quarter, lower spending at general merchandisers offset much of the sales gains registered at automotive dealerships, furniture and appliance stores, and building and supply outlets. Consumer surveys indicated some deterioration in consumer confidence in January. Recent indicators of housing demand and activity were mixed. Sales of new homes edged still lower in November (latest data available), and sales of existing homes declined by a larger amount in December than in November. However, housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable October decline, and conditions in mortgage markets remained quite favorable, led by a further decline in rates.  The sparse statistical data available on business fixed investment, along with anecdotal information, suggested a moderation recently in the expansion of business spending on capital goods, including some slowing of investment in computers. Investment in transportation equipment, however, apparently had held up well in the fourth quarter. Incoming data on construction contracts pointed to some slowing in the growth of nonresidential building activity from a relatively brisk pace during most of 1995.  The information available on business inventories suggested that inventory imbalances might have emerged in a few sectors in association with weaker-than-expected sales. Motor vehicle inventories were at elevated levels compared with sales in late 1995, and manufacturers responded by offering incentive packages on new cars and trucks and by adjusting downward their January production schedules. Data on manufacturing and retail trade inventories for November had been delayed, but published information on inventories held by wholesale distributors indicated a decline in that month, reversing part of October's sizable run-up. Much of the decline occurred in nondurable goods, although machinery distributors also reported a sizable liquidation. The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale trade sector edged down in November but remained near the high end of its range in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in October from its average rate in the third quarter. The value of imports declined by more than the value of exports. Much of the contraction in imports reflected reductions in oil and automotive products that more than offset another strong rise in computer goods. For exports, an advance in machinery exports to record levels was outweighed by a reduction in shipments of agricultural and automotive products. Available data on economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries suggested that the pace of expansion in Europe had slowed further on average while growth in Japan had picked up a little.  Recent data suggested little change in underlying inflation trends. Consumer prices increased slightly in December after being unchanged in November; food prices were quiescent over the two-month period while energy prices rose on balance, with a December rebound more than offsetting a sizable November drop. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices were up modestly over the November- December period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in 1994. Producer prices of finished goods were up considerably in November and December after having risen slowly in earlier months; in large part, the price increases late in the year reflected sharp upward movements in both finished foods and finished energy prices. For 1995, producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy rose at a subdued pace, though somewhat more than in 1994. Commodity prices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased somewhat in December after having been unchanged in November. Increases in average hourly earnings had been trending up over the past several years.  At its meeting on December 19, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, which was expected to result in a decline in the federal funds rate from around 5-3/4 percent to around 5-1/2 percent. The directive did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  After the meeting, open market operations were directed initially toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of reserve pressure that had been adopted by the Committee and thereafter toward maintaining this new reserve posture. Operations were complicated by large swings in reserve demands associated with year- end pressures and the adverse effects of unusually severe winter weather on check clearings. Although the federal funds rate exhibited somewhat greater volatility than normal over the period, it nonetheless averaged close to the expected level of 5-1/2 percent. The occasional periods of firmness in reserve market conditions contributed to higher adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, on average, over the period.  Most market interest rates had declined somewhat further over the period after the December 19 meeting. Rates moved lower immediately after the policy easing action, and most fell still more on balance over the remainder of the intermeeting interval in response to incoming information about the economy and the prospects for fiscal policy, at least in the near term. Both were seen as suggesting slower economic expansion for a time and an increased likelihood of additional easing of monetary policy in coming months. With bond yields down on balance, and occasionally approaching two-year lows, major indexes of equity prices advanced sharply further.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies continued to rise over the intermeeting period despite the decline in U.S. interest rates. The dollar's upward movement against the German mark and other European currencies was associated with increasing indications of further weakening of economic expansion in key European countries and greater declines in interest rates in those countries than in the United States. The dollar's appreciation relative to the Japanese yen appeared to be related in part to a narrowing of Japan's trade and current account surpluses. The dollar was unchanged on balance against the Canadian dollar, while the Mexican peso rose considerably in relation to the dollar.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and January. The pickup in M2 growth partly reflected the effect of recent declines in short-term interest rates; those declines had made money market instruments less attractive relative to household savings accounts in M2, whose offering rates tend to be adjusted downward with a considerable lag. In addition, the flattening of the term structure of interest rates had lessened the comparative attractiveness of bond mutual funds, which had continued to experience only light inflows. Faster growth of M3 in December and January was associated with both the pickup in M2 expansion and the issuance of additional large time deposits to help finance a noticeable step-up in bank loan demand in January. The expansion of M2 from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995 was in the upper half of the Committee's annual range, and M3 grew at the upper end of its range. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate in recent months, and for the year was near the midpoint of this aggregate's monitoring range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near term. This forecast was not materially different from that prepared for the December meeting, except for a slightly weaker outlook for the current quarter that was related in part to an inventory correction and the effects of unusually severe winter weather on spending and output. Over the remainder of the two-year forecast horizon, the economy was expected to grow generally along its estimated potential. Consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of disposable income; concerns about job security remained and consumer debt burdens had risen further, but the still-ample availability of credit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity holdings would support further increases in consumption. The further decline in mortgage rates recently from already-favorable levels would help to sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. With sales and profits projected to grow more slowly, and with utilization of existing capacity having eased considerably, business investment in new equipment and structures was expected to expand at a more moderate rate. In light of the recent strengthening of the dollar, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on real activity over the projection period as a whole. Much uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the recent impasse in the budget negotiations between the Administration and the Congress suggested a lower degree of fiscal restraint over coming years than had been assumed in the previous forecast. Given the projected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources and of inflation were not expected to change materially.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic activity, members noted a number of temporary factors that were retarding the expansion. The weakness in business activity this winter was to some extent the result of the partial shutdown of the federal government and the severe storms in a number of regions; both clearly were transitory influences on the economy. Growth of economic activity also was being constrained by production cutbacks stemming from efforts to bring stocks into better alignment with disappointing sales in a number of industries. Even so, in the absence of major overhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables, and given favorable conditions in financial markets, members believed that a resumption of moderate, sustainable growth after a relatively brief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy. At the same time, many observed that the risks to such an outcome did not seem balanced. A number of concerns, including the extent of the damping effects of high debt loads and employment uncertainty on consumption and questions about the sources of further export growth, suggested the possibility of sluggish expansion, while possible developments on the upside were more difficult to identify. With resource use unlikely to vary appreciably, the members generally expected no significant change in the underlying inflation picture over the year ahead. The recent performance of inflation had some encouraging aspects, and the odds on greater price pressures seemed relatively small at this time.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for the year 1996. Measured on the basis of chain-weighted indexes, the forecasts of the growth in real GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The members and nonmember presidents generally anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would be associated with employment growth close to that of the labor force. Accordingly, their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level, with a central tendency of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent and a full range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent. Projections of the rate of inflation, as reflected in the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent; that central tendency was on the high side of the outcome for 1995-- when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices--but a few of the forecasts anticipated a slightly lower rate of inflation.  In their review of developments across the nation, the Federal Reserve Bank presidents reported modest growth in most major areas of the country. Many referred, however, to an admixture of strengths and weaknesses in their local economies, and a majority observed that on balance growth in regional business activity appeared to have slowed in the last few months. In keeping with the data available for the nation as a whole, the slowing seemed to be concentrated in manufacturing and especially at firms producing motor vehicles and parts. Some presidents referred to relatively negative, or at least cautious, sentiment among many of their business contacts.  Much of the recent softening in economic activity appeared to arise from production cutbacks in various sectors of the economy where involuntary accumulation of inventories seemed to have occurred as a result of weaker sales trends in the past few months. The members expected this inventory adjustment process to have a relatively pronounced effect on production and overall business activity in the current quarter and perhaps to some extent in the second. While a greater-than-expected inventory adjustment with spreading effects through the economy could not be ruled out, the underlying strength of demand was likely to be sufficient to restore and sustain moderate growth in overall economic activity as the current inventory and production adjustments subsided.  With regard to consumer spending, members referred to overall indications of lackluster retail sales during the holiday season and into January. The anecdotal commentary on retail sales attributed some of the recent weakness in a number of areas to the clearly temporary effects of unusually severe winter weather and the partial shutdown of the federal government. The members anticipated that moderate growth in retail sales would resume, though some felt that the consumer sector might remain vulnerable on the downside. The consumer spending outlook was complicated by a number of crosscurrents. Negative factors cited by the members included ongoing concerns about job security that were being sustained by a continuing stream of workforce reduction announcements by major business concerns, increased consumer debt burdens that were showing up in rising delinquency rates on some types of loans, and the apparent satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables. On the positive side, reduced interest rates, still readily available credit, and the accumulation of financial wealth from the sharp rise in stock and bond prices were seen as likely to support continuing gains in consumer spending.  Further increases in business fixed investment were viewed as a likely prospect for the year ahead, though the growth of such investment probably would be well below the strong pace experienced earlier in the current cyclical expansion. Anecdotal reports indicated continuing strength in nonresidential construction in some parts of the country, but declining rates of capacity utilization augured reduced growth going forward. The expansion of investment in producers' durable equipment also was expected to slow, but from a pace that had seemed unsustainable. While appreciable further growth could be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business firms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their operations in a highly competitive environment, spending for other types of equipment was likely to be sluggish. Members noted in particular the prospects for weaker business spending for motor vehicles, especially for heavy trucks. However, the fundamental determinants of investment in business equipment, including the reduced cost of financing such investment, remained positive and this sector of the economy should continue to provide considerable impetus to the expansion.  The members also viewed the considerable decline that had occurred in mortgage interest rates and the ample availability of housing finance as key factors in their forecasts of sustained residential construction at relatively high levels. Adverse weather conditions appeared to have retarded home building activity in a number of areas in recent weeks, but several members commented that underlying trends in housing demand were favorable and that residential construction had remained relatively strong in several parts of the country.  The outlook for fiscal policy was uncertain, especially with regard to whether longer-term spending and taxation measures would be enacted to implement the goal of a balanced federal budget by the year 2002. For the year immediately ahead, however, the members continued to anticipate considerable restraint in federal spending, partly as a byproduct of the current budget debate between the Congress and the Administration. With regard to the external sector of the economy, prospects for economic growth in major trading partners--led by developments in Europe--appeared to have weakened, and the recent appreciation of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets also might tend to damp net exports. Consequently, several members saw downside risks in the foreign trade sector over the year ahead.  The members anticipated that inflation would remain contained in 1996, but they did not expect significant progress toward more stable prices. They referred to crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for wages and prices in the year ahead. Factors pointing to potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and relatively low grain supplies. More generally, resource utilization was expected to remain high and greater pressures could emerge in labor and product markets. Members noted that one broad measure of wages had picked up and that there was a small rise in the number of anecdotal reports indicating that labor shortages were contributing to higher wages in some parts of the country. In addition, unusually muted increases in the costs of worker benefits had been holding down overall compensation costs, and this pattern might not persist. On the other hand, high levels of resource utilization had been associated for some time with lower rates of growth in costs than would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience. In particular, a general sense of job insecurity in a period of major business restructurings was holding down increases in labor compensation. In an environment of strong competition, which was preventing many businesses from passing on rising costs through higher prices, firms continued to focus on efforts to control costs by improving the efficiency of their operations, and this was helping to hold down inflation. An apparent decline in inflationary expectations also would provide a moderating influence on inflation trends in the period ahead. While most of the members saw little reason to anticipate appreciably lower inflation over the year ahead, they also viewed the odds on a pickup in inflation as fairly low; they could see possible reasons for optimism on the long-run trend in inflation; and they generally remained confident that further progress toward price stability would be made over the longer term.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members supported a proposal calling for some slight easing in reserve conditions. Although a pickup to an acceptable rate of expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in coming quarters, the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to be significant. At the same time, while most members were forecasting high levels of resource use and little change in the rate of inflation this year, they saw only a very limited risk that a slight easing move might foster higher inflation under prevailing circumstances, and some felt that there were favorable prospects for a slightly improved inflation performance. Under the circumstances, a slight decrease was warranted in the real federal funds rate from a level that a number of members considered still a bit to the firm side--a stance that seemed less appropriate in light of the reduced threat over the last year of a pickup in inflation. One member pointed out that such a decrease would tend to counter the effects on aggregate demand of the recent rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which might continue to move higher if interest rate declines expected by the markets were not forthcoming. It was noted that postponing a decision in this uncertain economic climate could be defended on the ground that more evidence was needed to ascertain whether the weakness in the economy was quite temporary or more lasting; if it was the former, inflationary pressures could re-emerge at lower interest rates. On the other hand, a few members commented that the currently sluggish performance of the economy could be read as calling for a more pronounced easing move, but they preferred a cautious approach to policy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that surrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy.  The Chairman informed the Committee that he had asked the members of the Board of Governors to convene immediately after this meeting to consider a reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate. Such a reduction had been proposed by a total of six Federal Reserve Banks at this point. Given the easing in reserve markets favored by the Committee and the possibility of a lower discount rate, the members did not believe that a further policy move was likely to be needed during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, they favored an unbiased directive that did not incorporate a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the next several weeks. In keeping with its usual practice, the Committee did not rule out the possibility of an intermeeting policy change on the basis of unanticipated economic or financial developments.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members supported a directive that called for a slight reduction in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a bias about the likely direction of an adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period, should unanticipated developments warrant a change in policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has been growing rather slowly in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in December, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent. Industrial production increased only slightly further in the fourth quarter. Growth of consumer spending was modest, on balance, over the past several months. Housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable October decline. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a moderation in the expansion of spending on business equipment, and nonresidential construction has risen appreciably further. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in October from its average rate in the third quarter. There has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends.  Most market interest rates have declined somewhat since the Committee meeting on December 19. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen further over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, M2 expanded in the upper half of its range and M3 grew at the upper end of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate in recent months, placing this aggregate near the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible reduction in the discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for short-run policy: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Much of the information reviewed at this meeting had been influenced to an uncertain degree by unusually severe winter weather, industrial strikes, and U.S. government shutdowns. On balance, however, growth of economic activity appeared to have picked up after having slowed appreciably in late 1995. Growth in consumer spending seemed to have resumed at a moderate rate in the wake of January's storms; business spending on durable equipment was recording further healthy gains; and housing demand was showing some signs of strengthening. With businesses making considerable progress in getting their inventories under control, industrial production and employment had rebounded briskly. The recent data on prices gave little indication of any change in underlying inflation trends.  A surge in nonfarm payroll employment in February considerably more than offset a large weather-related drop in January. Very large job gains were recorded in February in the construction, retail trade, and services industries; however, some of these increases reflected the reversal of the depressing effects of January's severe winter storms and the efforts of some firms to make up for associated production losses. A small rise in manufacturing employment in February only partially offset a further loss of factory jobs in January. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in February.  Industrial production rose sharply in February, more than offsetting a sizable decline in January. Part of the net increase in output over the January-February period reflected an upturn in aircraft production after the settlement of a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer. In addition, output of office and computing machines continued to rise at a rapid pace, and the production of other types of business equipment picked up. Output of consumer goods changed little on balance over the two-month period. Manufacturing production expanded about in line with capacity over the first two months of the year, leaving the overall rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity little changed.  Nominal retail sales increased briskly in February after having registered little change in January. The February spurt was paced by strong motor vehicle purchases, but spending at general merchandise stores and apparel outlets also was up considerably after a weak performance in previous months. Sales at durable goods stores were less robust, rising only slightly in February. Recent indicators of housing demand and activity were generally favorable. Starts of both single-family and multifamily units moved higher on balance over January and February, and sales of new homes increased appreciably in January (latest data available). By contrast, sales of existing homes declined in January for a fourth consecutive month.  Business demand for durable equipment apparently remained fairly robust in early 1996. Incoming orders for computing equipment were particularly strong in January, and shipments of such equipment posted further healthy gains. With airline profits high and new models of airplanes being introduced, orders for aircraft had climbed rapidly over recent months. Orders for other types of equipment also had picked up on balance over the last several months, although shipments of such equipment dropped in January after a sizable rise in the fourth quarter. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to be growing more slowly: non-office commercial construction continued its upward trend but office, institutional, and industrial building activity had slowed noticeably in recent months, and contracts for those categories also had softened.  Business inventories rebounded sharply in January from a large drop in December. Much of the January buildup in stocks occurred in manufacturing, where part of the backup may have been associated with delays in shipments as a result of winter storms. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in January but was little changed on balance in recent months. Inventories at the wholesale level also rose considerably in January; the inventory-sales ratio increased slightly but was still well below the high levels of last fall. Retail stocks recorded a modest rise in January after a sharp decline in December. The January increase was in line with the advance in sales, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector as a whole was unchanged from December and remained well below levels seen over most of 1995.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in December (latest data available) was little changed from its November level. On a quarterly-average basis, however, the deficit in the fourth quarter was substantially smaller than it had been in the third quarter. The value of exports of goods and services rose appreciably in the fourth quarter, with the largest increases occurring in machinery exports and foreign tourist services. The value of imports declined slightly, largely as a result of decreases in imports of automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The data available on economic conditions in the major foreign industrial countries in early 1996 suggested that a moderate recovery was under way in Japan, and there were some signs of a pickup in activity in much of Western Europe, although the German economy remained weak.  Inflation trends had remained stable in recent months. At the consumer level, food prices continued to edge up in February and energy prices again were under appreciable upward pressure. Excluding the often-volatile food and energy items, consumer prices advanced in February at a slightly slower rate than in January; and for the twelve months ended in February, consumer prices rose a little less than in the comparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on balance over January and February; the rise in this measure of prices over the twelve months ended in February was somewhat larger than in the comparable year-earlier interval. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers edged down in February after a considerable increase in January. However, for the twelve-month period ended in February, average hourly earnings rose more than in the year-earlier period.  At its meeting on January 30-31, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a slight reduction in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, should unanticipated developments warrant a policy change. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  On January 31, the Board of Governors approved a reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate, to a level of 5 percent. The decrease was made effective immediately and was passed through to interest rates in reserve markets. Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining this new policy stance, and the federal funds rate averaged around 5-1/4 percent, the level expected to be associated with that stance.  Because the easing move had been largely anticipated in financial markets, the initial response was a small decline in short- term rates and little change in long-term rates. Over the remainder of the period, however, most interest rates moved higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting improved prospects for economic growth and, accordingly, a reduced likelihood of further easings in monetary policy. In addition, the absence of much progress in federal budget negotiations was viewed by the markets as indicating that the chances a major multiyear deficit-reduction plan would be adopted this year were becoming more remote. Despite the increase in bond yields, major indexes of equity prices recorded sizable gains.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell appreciably during the initial portion of the period -- before evidence of a more robust U.S. economy emerged -- while data on German money supply and the Japanese economy were suggesting upward revisions to expected interest rates abroad. In late February, emerging signs that the U.S. economy was generally stronger than expected and that economic conditions abroad were comparatively weaker than they had seemed earlier fostered a rebound in the value of the dollar.  Growth of the broader monetary aggregates strengthened considerably in February and early March following the decline in short-term interest rates in late 1995 and early 1996. The acceleration of M2 reflected a surge in demand deposits as well as larger inflows to retail money market mutual funds, whose yields tend to adjust with a lag to changes in short-term market interest rates. Larger inflows to institution-only money market funds contributed to M3's stronger performance. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt slowed somewhat in December and January, reflecting reduced federal government borrowing, but remained moderate on balance.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the pace of economic expansion would pick up over coming months after a sluggish fourth quarter. Other than a better performance over the first half of 1996 associated with somewhat faster increase in final sales, this forecast differed little from that prepared for the previous meeting and indicated that the economy was expected to expand generally along its estimated potential. Consumer spending was projected to grow slightly more than disposable income; the favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample availability of credit were expected to outweigh persisting consumer concerns about job security and the effects of already high household debt burdens. Homebuilding activity was projected to decline a little in response to the recent backup in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level. A less rapid pace of business investment in equipment and structures was expected in light of the decline over the past year in the rate of utilization of production capacity and the moderate growth projected for sales and profits. The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period. The persisting impasse in the federal budget negotiations suggested little further fiscal contraction in coming quarters. Given the outlook for economic activity, rates of utilization of labor and capital were not expected to change materially and inflation was projected to increase modestly.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the resiliency of the economy, which appeared to have strengthened appreciably after a period of subpar growth. The latter had been induced to a large extent by inventory adjustments whose effects were exacerbated temporarily by government shutdowns, unusually severe winter weather, and industrial strikes. The adjustment in inventory investment seemed to be nearing its completion, and some members observed that the settlement of the recent strike in the motor vehicle industry might well impart added impetus to the expansion over the nearer term. Considerable volatility could be expected in the short-run performance of the economy, but the members continued to view trend growth at a pace near the economy's potential as the most probable outcome. Many also commented that the risks to such a forecast appeared to have shifted from being predominantly on the downside earlier in the year to better balanced currently. Still, substantial uncertainties attended the economic outlook, and a number of members observed that an economic performance that differed considerably in either direction from their current forecasts might well materialize over the projection period. Regarding the outlook for inflation, members' assessments tended to center on expectations of little change in average consumer price inflation over the projection horizon.  The review of regional economic developments by the Federal Reserve Bank presidents pointed to moderate expansion in economic activity across much of the nation, though growth was described as modest in a few regions and relatively robust in some others. Business conditions appeared to have improved in a number of areas since early in the year, but as had been true previously, activity in various sectors of the economy remained uneven. Manufacturing of most durable goods other than motor vehicles and some defense industry products displayed considerable strength, while the production of many nondurable goods tended to lag. In agriculture, high feed costs and low market prices were depressing the cattle industry, while elevated grain prices were boosting the incomes of farmers not subject to the effects of locally adverse weather conditions.  The economy had displayed considerable resilience in the face of adjustments to production associated with efforts by many business firms to reduce inventories and a number of additional, albeit temporary, developments that had tended to retard the expansion in the latter part of 1995 and at the start of this year. Apparently, relatively low long-term interest rates and the related substantial appreciation in the value of stock and bond market holdings had been important factors helping to sustain spending in this period. In the context of continued underlying momentum in final demand and some decline in excess stocks of unsold motor vehicles stemming from the recently ended strike at a major domestic producer, inventories now seemed to be in better balance with sales and the economy to be better positioned to accommodate sustained expansion. Some members observed, however, that the recent increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates would tend to blunt demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Moreover, stock market prices had risen to comparatively high levels in relation to earnings and interest rates and might be vulnerable to further weakness in the debt markets or to any tendency for business profit margins to erode.  In the course of their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to recent indications, including anecdotal reports, of appreciable strengthening in retail sales that tended to support forecasts of sustained growth in consumer spending in coming quarters. In addition, surveys of consumer sentiment, which had been more favorable recently, and sharply increased household net worth were seen as positive factors in the outlook for consumer expenditures. On the negative side, some members observed that the rise in consumer indebtedness and the recent increase in interest rates would tend to damp consumer spending. Given these financial crosscurrents, it was suggested that growth in consumer spending might approximate that of disposable income over the forecast horizon.  The prospects for business capital spending remained a sup- portive element in the outlook for further economic expansion, but growth in such spending was expected to slow considerably from its rapid pace over the past few years. The ready availability and fairly low cost of business finance in equity and debt markets and the continuing commitment of business firms to modernizing their facilities to hold down costs in highly competitive markets would tend to support growth in business fixed investment. Profits and cash flows were expected to remain reasonably strong, though there were tentative signs of some softening in profit margins. On the other hand, the longevity of the current expansion had resulted in the addition of a good deal of production capacity in recent years. This development in conjunction with some decline in capacity utilization over the past several quarters pointed to less need for expansion in plant and equipment. The rise in outlays for computers and related products was likely to remain fairly robust in light of the continuing advances in technology and the marked downtrend in computer prices, but the growth of computer expenditures was projected to be well below the extraordinary pace of the past few years. The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.  Housing activity generally was expected to be well maintained in coming quarters, though likely to moderate to some extent from current levels in lagged response to the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates. The response of housing expenditures to rate increases was uncertain, and a few members commented that the prospective slowing in housing construction could be fairly pronounced. For the nearer term, however, recent data were indicative of considerable underlying strength in housing markets, especially in light of the adverse effects of notably unfavorable weather conditions in many parts of the country this winter. Those data tended to be supported by anecdotal reports of significant improvement in housing markets in several regions over the course of recent months. Contributing to that performance, however, might be a temporary acceleration of purchases by home buyers who anticipated further increases in mortgage interest rates. The latter were viewed, nonetheless, as still low in comparison with their average level over the past several years.  The outlook for fiscal policy remained uncertain, especially for future years. It was suggested that the stalemate between the Congress and the Administration on major spending and tax issues might not be resolved in coming months or indeed during the current session of Congress. However, already legislated appropriations and current continuing resolutions still pointed to considerable restraint in federal spending this year. With regard to the external sector of the economy, projections of appreciable growth in exports tended to be supported by anecdotal comments of strong export demand for goods produced in various parts of the country, including some improvement in exports to Mexico. At the same time, imports might well expand somewhat more rapidly than exports if the domestic economy strengthened as projected this year from its reduced rate of growth in 1995.  The members did not differ greatly in their assessments of the most probable course of inflation. Their expectations ranged from essentially unchanged to slightly higher inflation in comparison with 1995. At the same time, members expressed somewhat differing views about possible deviations of inflation from their expectations. Those who emphasized the risks of higher-than-projected inflation tended to cite the potential for increasing wage and price pressures in an economy that already was operating at or close to its estimated capacity. Increases in labor costs had been unusually subdued in light of the relatively low unemployment nationwide and widespread anecdotal reports of labor shortages. In this view the rise in labor costs could well accelerate at some point, though not necessarily in the near term, with some feedthrough to prices. Other developments that generated some concern about the outlook for inflation included the rise in the costs of medical benefits in the fourth quarter, price pressures in the energy and food sectors of the economy, and the possibility that the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates might to some extent reflect worsening inflationary expectations. Other members saw only a limited risk of higher inflation, and a few indicated that they did not rule out some reduction in consumer price inflation from that experienced in 1995. In this view there was sufficient capacity in the economy to allow room for moderate growth of economic activity in line with their forecasts without fostering added inflation. Moreover, there was only scattered evidence of accelerating increases in worker compensation associated with labor shortages and little indication that possibly diminishing worries about job security would induce rising labor militancy. Some members also stressed the persistence of strong competition in numerous markets that tended to preclude or restrain raising prices.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained. The economy seemed to have adequate forward momentum and did not appear to require any further stimulus, whose implementation might contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. Several members observed that robust growth in broad money for some months suggested that monetary policy had been supportive of sustained economic expansion. At the same time, information on the economy and prices did not seem to indicate developing inflation pressures that needed to be contained by tightening policy at this juncture. Indeed, some members commented that, judged from one perspective, financial conditions had tightened somewhat as a consequence of the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, though it was difficult to disentangle the real and the inflation components of the rate increases. Nonetheless, a number of members noted that inflation was not expected to moderate further over the projection horizon and that it could move higher and the Committee would need to be particularly vigilant in guarding against such an outcome. Against this background, the members favored an unbiased instruction in the directive that did not prejudice possible intermeeting adjustments to policy in either direction.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated a preference for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  Many of the data for recent months reviewed at this meeting were influenced to an uncertain degree by unusually severe winter weather, industrial strikes, and U.S. government shutdowns. On balance, the expansion in economic activity appears to have picked up after slowing appreciably in late 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment surged in February, considerably more than offsetting a large drop in January, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent. Manufacturing production increased sharply in February after a sizable decline in January. Growth of consumer spending, which had been sluggish earlier in the winter, spurted in February, paced by strong motor vehicle purchases. Housing starts rose in January and February. Orders and contracts point to continuing expansion of spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially in the fourth quarter from its average rate in the third quarter. There has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends.  Changes in short-term market interest rates have been mixed while long-term rates have risen appreciably since the Committee meeting on January 30-31. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined slightly over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 has strengthened considerably in recent months, while expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained moderate on balance.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in January established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded moderately on balance in recent months. Final demand, which had been quite robust early in the year, was showing some signs of slowing in recent data. Consumer spending appeared to be growing at a moderate pace; business expenditures on durable equipment had registered further large gains, though new orders had flattened out; and housing demand seemed to be holding up well despite the increase in mortgage interest rates this year. Business inventories, most notably in the automotive industry, had been brought into better alignment with sales, and industrial production and employment had risen appreciably. Upward pressures on food and energy prices accounted for somewhat larger increases in consumer prices.  Nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in April after rising substantially in the first quarter; part of the slowdown resulted from an unwinding of special factors that had boosted job growth in the first quarter. Payrolls continued to expand in April in retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; and the services industries. In contrast, cmployment in construction fell sharply, reversing much of the large first-quarter gain. In manufacturing, employment declined further in April despite the settlement of a major strike in the automotive sector and the return of affected workers to their jobs. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent.  Industrial production rebounded in April from an appreciable decline in March. The changes in industrial output over the two-month period largely reflected fluctuations in motor vehicle assemblies associated with a strike and its subsequent settlement. Manufacturing of products other than motor vehicles rose moderately in April on the strength of further large advances in the output of office and computing equipment and of construction supplies. Utilization of total industrial capacity, which had varied in recent months in concert with movements in production, climbed in April to a rate slightly above that of the fourth quarter of 1995.  Retail sales declined somewhat in April after posting a strong gain in the first quarter. Sales of durable goods, which had increased substantially in the first quarter, retraced part of that advance in April; the drop more than offset a further rise in sales of nondurable goods. Housing activity was well sustained in April, with the run-up in mortgage rates that began in February having had little perceptible effect to date. Single-family housing starts were up considerably in April, and sales of new and existing homes remained brisk in March (latest data available).  Business fixed investment accelerated sharply in the first quarter of 1996 following three quarters of relatively moderate expansion; however, recent data on orders and contracts pointed, on balance, to some deceleration in business spending on both durable equipment and nonresidential structures. Much of the first-quarter pickup reflected stronger spending for durable equipment; purchases of computing equipment remained robust and spending on other durable equipment increased. Nonresidential construction activity also advanced further in the first quarter; however, construction of office buildings continued to lag, and construction of other commercial buildings slowed after recording strong gains for several years.  Business inventories declined in March after rising appreciably on average over January and February; inventory accumulation over the quarter as a whole was of modest proportions, as firms sought to bring stocks into better balance with sales. In manufacturing, inventories changed little in March and the ratio of stocks to sales was not far above historical lows. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined a little further in March, reflecting a reduction in stocks of motor vehicles, and the inventory-sales ratio remained near the middle of its range in recent years. Retail inventories also declined in March, with cuts in stocks of motor vehicles more than accounting for the drop. The inventory-sales ratio for the retail sector was near the low end of its range in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in the first quarter was substantially larger than in the fourth quarter of last year. The value of imports increased sharply in the first quarter after declining in the two previous quarters. Moreover, growth in the value of exports slowed considerably in the first quarter from the pace of other recent quarters. Available data indicated that the performance of the economies of the major foreign industrial countries was mixed in the first quarter. The recovery in Japan was still under way while economic activity in continental Europe remained generally weak, with the German economy apparently having contracted further and the French economy exhibiting signs of only a modest upturn after a fourth-quarter decline. Moderate further expansion in economic activity evidently was occurring in Canada and the United Kingdom.  Rising crude oil and, to a lesser extent, food prices led to somewhat larger increases in consumer and producer price indexes in March and April. For nonfood, non-energy items, however, consumer prices rose only slightly in April after three months of somewhat faster advances; over the twelve months ended in April, this measure of consumer inflation increased a little less than the rise over the comparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy items recorded a third straight small increase in April. Over the twelve months ended in April, this measure of producer prices rose slightly less than over the comparable year-earlier period. Hourly compensation of private industry workers expanded in the first quarter at the average rate for all of 1995; the growth was associated with a decline in benefit costs and a sharp rise in wages and salaries.  At its meeting on March 21, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period, and the federal funds rate averaged near 5-1/4 percent, the level expected to be associated with that unchanged policy stance. Other short-term market interest rates changed little over the period, and because the Committee's decision had been largely anticipated in financial markets, longer-term rates also were little changed initially. Over the remainder of the period, however, intermediate- and long-term rates came under upward pressure when incoming economic data were seen by market participants as pointing to stronger growth in output and employment and therefore to a somewhat tighter monetary policy stance than previously had been expected. Despite the increase in bond yields, most indexes of stock prices rose on balance over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting generally favorable first-quarter earnings reports and the improved economic outlook.  In foreign exchange markets, the rise of U.S. interest rates contributed to a considerable appreciation of the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies. The dollar was particularly strong against the German mark, reflecting incoming data that suggested continued weakness in economic activity in Germany and, accordingly, a greater likelihood of further monetary policy easing by the Bundesbank. The dollar rose less against the yen, partly owing to information indicating a strengthening of the economic recovery in Japan and heightened market expectations of a near-term tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan.  Growth of M2 and M3 slowed substantially in April after having recorded sizable increases earlier in the year. Weakness in demand deposits after unusually rapid first-quarter expansion and sluggishness in currency demand were factors in the slowdown. In addition, the rise in market interest rates in recent months, which had increased the opportunity costs of holding retail deposits, likely had a restraining effect on these deposits. For the year through April, both aggregates grew at rates somewhat above the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained moderate on balance over recent months, and this aggregate stayed near the middle of its monitoring range for the year.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would remain generally around its estimated potential. Consumer spending was expected to grow in line with disposable income; the favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample availability of credit were expected to outweigh persisting consumer concerns about job security and the influence of already-high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was projected to decline a little in response to the recent backup in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level because of generally supportive employment and income conditions and the still- favorable cash-flow affordability of homeownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was expected to grow less rapidly in light of the projected moderate growth of sales and profits and the lower rate of utilization of production capacity now prevailing. The external sector was projected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period, even though an anticipated firming of economic activity abroad would bolster demand for U.S. exports. Little additional fiscal contraction was anticipated over the projection period. Inflation recently had been lifted by adverse developments in the energy market and was projected to remain above the levels of recent years, given the high level of resource utilization and the effects of tight grain supplies on food prices. Further risks of inflationary pressure were associated with a possible elevation of the federal minimum wage.  In their discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the economy had been stronger this year than they had anticipated and appeared to be growing at a quite robust pace. However, they generally expected the expansion to slow, keeping the economy close to its potential. Views differed to some extent with regard to the risks surrounding such an outlook. Some saw those risks as fairly evenly balanced, given prospective restraint from the rise in bond yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar since early this year. Others expressed concern that economic growth might continue at a pace that could increase pressures on resources, with adverse implications for inflation in an economy already operating in the neighborhood of its estimated long-term potential. Moreover, faster increases in energy and food prices could contribute to higher overall inflation, both directly and by boosting inflationary expectations, and the proposed increase in the minimum wage would add to cost pressures if it were enacted into law. Nonetheless, while the chances of a pickup in inflation later had risen to some extent, a number of members emphasized that no firm evidence had surfaced thus far to signal that labor compensation was increasing at a faster rate or that core inflation was worsening, and even the early signs of increased pressures on costs and prices were mixed. The last few years had witnessed significantly lower cost pressures and more subdued inflation than typically would have been experienced in earlier years with similar rates of resource utilization, but whether this favorable outcome would persist was an open question.  Members observed that the stronger-than-expected performance of the economy thus far this year reflected relatively rapid growth in final demand. Favorable financial conditions, notably the relatively low interest rates of the latter part of 1995 and early 1996 and increases in wealth stemming from sizable advances in stock market prices, evidently were undergirding the expansion. Indications of improving or continuing high levels of economic activity were widespread across the nation according to recent anecdotal reports and regional data, though agricultural conditions in many areas were cited as a significant exception. While the economy appeared to have solid and balanced momentum that pointed to sustained growth, a number of factors were seen as likely to foster more moderate expansion beginning in the second half of the year. These included the effects of higher intermediate- and long-term interest rates on interest- sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing, consumer durables, and business fixed investment. The appreciation of the dollar over the past year and near-term moderation in federal government spending also were expected to exert some restraint on economic activity over the forecast horizon. Some members also questioned the sustainability of the performance of the stock market; a correction in this market would help to restrain aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the continued strength in economic activity raised questions about whether these developments would damp demand sufficiently to keep resource utilization at sustainable levels.  In their review of recent developments and the outlook for key sectors of the economy, members noted that consumer spending had strengthened considerably this year after a period of sluggish growth in late 1995. The recent data on consumer spending were reinforced by anecdotal reports from various parts of the country. The wealth effects from the further gains that had occurred in stock market prices, along with sustained increases in employment and a ready availability of consumer financing, were seen as playing a positive role in boosting consumer expenditures. Barring changes in these underlying factors, continued growth in consumer spending seemed likely, although members referred to developments that could begin to slow such growth over the months ahead. The latter included the satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables and fairly elevated levels of consumer debt. On balance, moderate expansion in consumer expenditures, perhaps in line with the growth in incomes, seemed likely over the projection period.  Business fixed investment was believed likely to remain a source of considerable strength in the expansion, though growth in this sector of the economy also was expected to moderate from the elevated pace thus far this year. The desire of many business firms and other users of capital equipment to take advantage of new, more effective, and less expensive computer and other technologies and more generally to add further to capital in an effort to reduce costs in highly competitive markets would continue to underpin investment spending. In addition, equity and other financing remained available on relatively attractive terms. On the other hand, the rise in business investment in recent years had brought capital stocks into more acceptable alignment with expected sales, damping the need for further sizable additions.  Business firms appeared to have completed, or nearly completed, their efforts to bring inventories into better balance with sales, including the rebuilding of motor vehicle stocks after the strike at a major manufacturer was settled in March. On the basis of recent experience, subdued growth in inventories could be anticipated in the context of the projected expansion of overall economic activity at a pace near the economy's long-run potential. It was suggested, however, that such an expectation implied relatively restrained inventory investment in comparison with past cyclical patterns. Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.  With regard to the outlook for housing, the rise in mortgage rates in the past few months could be expected to retard residential construction activity to some extent. Thus far. however, increased interest costs did not appear to have had any perceptible effects on housing sales or construction. Indeed, the housing sector was continuing to display a good deal of strength in many parts of the country. Some members observed that the appreciable momentum in housing activity reflected strength in the underlying fundamentals, including continued affordability, that seemed likely to sustain a high level of housing construction for a considerable period of time despite somewhat higher mortgage rates.  In the area of fiscal policy, legislative agreement had not yet been reached on how to implement the objective of a balanced federal budget over time, but decisions covering the nearer term implied continued budget restraint. On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.  The outlook for inflation was of key importance to the formulation of monetary policy at this time, but it was clouded by substantial uncertainty. One source of uncertainty was the behavior of food and energy prices. Increases in these prices largely accounted for the more rapid rise in consumer prices thus far this year, and they likely would continue to add to inflation in the months ahead. Retail energy prices had risen appreciably, but at least some of that increase was expected to be reversed over the near term. Retail food prices did not yet display any significant effects from the sizable rise in grain prices in recent months, and while some effects on retail prices were likely, their extent and duration were difficult to gauge at this point. Moreover, it was difficult to anticipate how much the higher food and energy prices might affect inflation expectations and wage demands and thereby potentially become embedded more generally in the price structure.  Also of concern to the members were the possible effects on inflation of continued pressures on resources, especially if the current pace of the expansion should fail to moderate as much as projected. In recent years, the relationship between resource use and inflation had not followed earlier patterns. In particular, increases in labor compensation had been comparatively subdued over an extended period of what seemed to be relatively full employment highlighted by anecdotal reports of scarcities of various types of labor in numerous parts of the country. In part, worker willingness to accept comparatively limited increases in compensation could be attributed to the apparent rise in insecurity about the permanence of jobs or the availability of alternative jobs, but the reasons were not fully understood. From the standpoint of the inflation outlook, it therefore was uncertain how long the period of relatively restrained increases in labor compensation would last. Against this background, a number of members indicated that they perceived an appreciable risk of rising labor costs and related inflation, even though there was little evidence to date of such developments; others noted that they could not rule out the possibility that the favorable experience would be extended.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The members agreed that the balance of risks on inflation had shifted substantially since early in the year. At that time, the economy had seemed sluggish and inflation was seen as possibly easing, but more recent developments indicated that the economy was stronger and rising inflation down the road could not be ruled out. Nonetheless, while policy might need to be firmed at some point to head off emerging inflation pressures, financial conditions were not so obviously stimulative as to counsel a need for any immediate tightening of policy. The real federal funds rate probably was not greatly out of line with its appropriate level, and the rise in longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate meant that financial conditions were now exerting more restraint than earlier this year. More information might provide a better sense of how the higher interest rates were affecting aggregate demand and perhaps also help--to a small degree--to shed light on the considerable uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to inflation. In any event, actual inflation data--apart from food and energy prices--and many of the usual early warning signs of mounting price pressures did not yet indicate a pickup in the underlying trend of prices. Accordingly, the members viewed policy as appropriately positioned under current circumstances, though ongoing developments would need to be reassessed at the upcoming meeting in early July. Some members noted that the Committee would need to anticipate, and act to preclude, a rise in the core rate of inflation that, if it were to materialize, would be difficult and costly to reverse. In this regard. the view was expressed that a firming in policy sooner rather than later was likely to end up promoting stability in output and prices.  In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy, all the members indicated at least some preference for retaining a symmetric directive. Members commented that the probability of developments during this period that would warrant a change in policy before the next meeting was quite low, Moreover, symmetry did not rule out an intermeeting adjustment, and the Chairman could call for a Committee consultation should the incoming information raise questions about the stance of monetary policy. Some members felt that it was especially appropriate that a policy action that represented a reversal of the previous move be made with a full discussion at a regular meeting. Some members also commented that an asymmetric directive toward restraint would imply a predisposition on the part of the Committee to tighten policy at some point, possibly at the next meeting. While they would be prepared to take such a step if the evidence warranted, their preference was to come into the July meeting without such a presumption.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated a preference for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, on balance, economic activity has grown moderately in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment changed little in April after rising substantially in the first quarter; the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent. Industrial production increased sharply in April, largely reflecting a rebound in motor vehicle assemblies after a strike in March. Retail sales declined somewhat in April after posting a strong gain in the first quarter. Single-family housing starts rose considerably in April. Orders and contracts point to some deceleration in spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures after a very rapid expansion in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened significantly in the first quarter from its rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Upward pressures on food and energy prices have led to somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index over recent months.  Short-term market interest rates have changed little while long-term rates have risen somewhat further since the Committee meeting on March 26. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has appreciated considerably over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 slowed substantially in April after recording sizable increases earlier in the year. For the year through April, both aggregates grew at rates somewhat above the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained moderate on balance over recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in January established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity advanced considerably further in the second quarter, although growth in aggregate final demand showed some signs of slowing. Consumer spending continued to post sizable gains, but business investment in equipment and structures apparently was rising less vigorously, and higher mortgage rates evidently were starting to exert some restraint on housing construction activity. Business inventories had been brought into better balance with sales, and production and employment had risen appreciably. Upward pressures on food and energy prices had led to somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index over recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand briskly over April and May. Job gains were concentrated in the service-producing and construction industries, while employment in manufacturing was stable on balance over the April-May period after having declined somewhat in 1995 and the first quarter of 1996. The civilian unemployment rate rose in May to 5.6 percent, which was the average rate for the year to date.  Industrial production increased appreciably further in May. In contrast to April's advance, much of which had resulted from the resumption of operations at a major motor vehicle manufacturer after the settlement of a strike, the May rise largely reflected gains in a wide range of non-auto-related manufacturing industries as well as a weather-related jump in electricity generation. The surge in overall output lifted total utilization of industrial capacity somewhat above the average rate recorded during the previous two quarters.  Total nominal retail sales surged in May after having changed little in April; the increase in sales, coupled with available information on prices, suggested that real consumer spending on goods had risen substantially on balance since the first quarter. Recent data (available through April) indicated that spending on services had increased moderately on balance in recent months. Single-family housing starts fell considerably in May from the relatively high April level. The decline suggested that the rise in mortgage rates in recent months had begun to damp construction activity, but indicators of housing demand, such as sales of new and existing homes, remained relatively robust.  Growth in business expenditures on durable equipment and nonresidential structures appeared to be slowing following a surge in outlays in the first quarter. In May, shipments of nondefense capital goods rebounded from the substantial decline in April; however, excluding movements in the volatile aircraft category, shipments were down on balance over the two months. Among the major components, shipments of both computing and communications equipment fell sharply in April and retraced only part of that decline in May. Recent data on new orders pointed to more modest increases in spending on business equipment over the months ahead. Nonresidential building activity increased considerably further in April (latest data available), but incoming information on contracts suggested that growth in nonresidential construction would weaken somewhat in coming months.  Businesses had made considerable progress in recent months in bringing their inventories into better alignment with sales. In manufacturing, stocks rose moderately in April after a decline in March. The stock-to-shipments ratio dropped further in April and was at a low level. At the wholesale trade level, inventory accumulation was appreciable in April after several months of modest growth. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector edged up in April but remained well below the elevated levels of last fall. Retail inventories increased slightly in April after a large decline in March associated with a substantial liquidation of motor vehicle stocks. The aggregate ratio of inventories to sales for retail establishments was around the lower end of its range in recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April from its rate in the first quarter, reflecting a slightly larger increase in the value of imports than in that of exports. The expansion in imports was concentrated in oil as U.S. refiners sought to meet growing domestic demand and rebuild their inventories. The rise in exports was broadly based, although exports of computers, semiconductors, and automotive products edged off. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have expanded moderately on balance since the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, economic performance ranged from unexpectedly robust in Japan to further weakness in Germany; the limited data available for the second quarter suggested a slowdown in Japan, a bounceback in Germany, and moderate growth in other major trading partners.  Although upward pressures on energy prices continued to boost overall consumer prices in April and May, price increases for nonfood, non-energy items remained small. Over the twelve months ended in May, the increase in core consumer prices was appreciably smaller than in the previous twelve-month period; much of the deceleration reflected swings in automobile finance charges. At the producer level, higher prices for finished energy goods over April and May were partially offset by slightly lower prices for finished foods; prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were little changed over the two-month period and rose less over the twelve months ended in May than in the comparable year-earlier period. Data on average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers indicated that this measure of labor costs had increased by a somewhat larger amount in the year ended in May than in the comparable year-earlier period.  At its meeting on May 21, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged near 5-1/4 percent, the level expected to be associated with the unchanged policy stance. Because the Committee's decision had been largely anticipated in financial markets, other market interest rates also were little changed during the early part of the period. However, market rates increased appreciably following the release of a strong employment report in early June, though most of that rise was later retraced as expectations of near-term tightening of monetary policy diminished. On balance, most market rates were up a little over the intermeeting period. Major indexes of stock prices were down on balance over the period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period. The dollar declined against the German mark and other European currencies as growing indications of a recent pickup in economic activity in Germany damped market expectations of any further easing of monetary policy by the Bundesbank. By contrast, the dollar rose against the yen in apparent response to a series of statements by Japanese officials suggesting that there would be no near-term firming of Japanese monetary policy.  The broad monetary aggregates were weak in May: M2 declined, and M3 expanded relatively sluggishly. The weakness in M2 and M3 was associated in part with the adverse effects of the earlier rise in market interest rates on the opportunity costs of holding deposits. Deposit balances also may have been drawn down to meet unusually large individual tax liabilities on the April 15 tax date. Partial data for June pointed to a rebound in both aggregates. For the year through June, these aggregates were estimated to have grown at rates around the upper bounds of their respective annual ranges. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt had slowed somewhat in recent months, but the debt aggregate had remained in the middle portion of its annual range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a sizable advance in economic activity in the second quarter, growth would moderate and the economy would expand around or perhaps a little above its estimated potential. Consumer spending was projected to expand at a more moderate pace, in line with disposable income; the favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample availability of credit were expected to balance persisting consumer concerns about job and retirement security and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to slow somewhat in response to the back-up in residential mortgage rates but was expected to remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits and the reduced rate of utilization of production capacity now prevailing. The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period, even though an anticipated firming of economic activity abroad would bolster demand for U.S. exports. Little further fiscal contraction was forecast over the projection period. Inflation recently had been lifted by adverse developments in energy markets and was projected to remain above the levels of recent years, given the still-high level of resource utilization and the effects of tight grain supplies on food prices.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the stronger-than-expected expansion in overall economic activity in recent months, but for a variety of reasons they anticipated that growth would slow appreciably over the second half of the year to a pace more in line with the growth in the economy's potential. Key factors bearing on this outlook included the prospective effects of the rise in interest rates and the dollar that had occurred since earlier in the year and the waning influence of transitory factors that had stimulated economic activity in the second quarter. The members generally agreed, however, that, apart from evidence of some moderation in the growth of business investment expenditures from a very rapid pace, there were few hard indications of a slowing in the expansion and the risks were clearly to the upside of their current forecasts. Against that background, they were concerned that inflation could begin to rise. Cost and price pressures had been surprisingly well contained at high levels of resource utilization, but this unusually favorable performance might not be sustained, and in any event even greater resource utilization, as would occur if growth did not moderate appreciably, carried substantial inflation risk. There were some scattered indications in statistical and anecdotal reports that tended to suggest that wage inflation might be trending higher, although key measures of price inflation, excluding their food and energy components, continued to display a flat or even a declining trend.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1996 and 1997. (The ranges in this paragraph take into account minor revisions made by a few members subsequent to the meeting.) The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1996 as a whole had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent, reflecting expectations of considerable moderation in the rate of economic growth over the second half of the year; for 1997, the projections centered on continued moderate growth of GDP in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts were concentrated in growth ranges of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1996 and 4-1/4 to 5 percent for 1997. The civilian rate of unemployment associated with these forecasts was expected by most members to remain around 5-1/2 percent this year and to be in a range of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent in 1997. This level of resource utilization was expected to be associated with a slightly higher rate of inflation in 1996, as measured by the consumer price index, than that recorded in 1995 owing to developments in the food and energy sectors, but a decline was anticipated in 1997. Specifically, the projections converged on rates of 3 to 3-1/4 percent in 1996 and 2-3/4 to 3 percent in 1997. The projections for both 1996 and 1997 were based on individual views concerning what would be an appropriate monetary policy over the projection horizon.  In their assessment of factors bearing on the outlook for final demand, members commented that growth in consumer spending was likely to moderate in coming quarters from its pace thus far this year. This moderation would reflect the projected slowing in income growth. While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors. The latter included the increase in consumer indebtedness, satisfaction of earlier pent-up demand for consumer durable goods, and continuing concern about job security. Higher interest rates also were expected to exert an inhibiting effect on purchases of consumer durables, including those related to housing. Some members observed that while slower growth in consumer spending was the most probable forecast, they saw an upside risk from the wealth effects of the large rise that had occurred in the value of stock market holdings.  Business expenditures for plant and equipment were expected to grow at a slower though still appreciable pace. Indeed, such spending already appeared to be moderating. Contract data suggested that nonresidential construction activity was on a slowing growth trajectory and expansion of outlays for producers' durable equipment also appeared to have softened. Given the outlook for slower growth in final demand, many businesses would not have to add significantly to capacity. However, spending for computing equipment, while perhaps moderating from the exceptional pace of recent quarters, was thought likely to remain buoyant as continuing innovations and declining prices stimulated further solid gains in this segment of business spending.  Housing was seen as another important sector of the economy that was likely to exert a retarding effect on the expansion as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was felt increasingly in housing markets. The anecdotal information from around the nation and the available statistics suggested, however, that those markets generally had remained surprisingly ebullient thus far, and there were only limited indications of some softening in home construction activity.  Business inventory investment was viewed as a key upside risk in the economic outlook for coming quarters. An inventory overhang at the end of last year had been corrected in the first quarter, and inventory investment was indicated to have turned positive again in the second quarter. However, current inventory-to-sales ratios appeared to be relatively lean, and final sales that exceeded current expectations might well induce a sharp upward adjustment in inventory accumulation, especially if lead times were to lengthen and producers perceived shortfalls in their safety stocks.  Members viewed the outlook for inflation as a source of substantial uncertainty in their forecasts, though many saw reasonable prospects that a rate of economic expansion in line with their forecasts and associated levels of capacity utilization would prove to be consistent with little change in the core rate of inflation. Some important measures of price inflation, after adjustment to exclude their volatile food and energy components, had shown a flat or even a declining trend in recent quarters. The outlook for overall price increases would remain contingent in part on food and energy price developments, but more importantly on underlying cost pressures in the economy.  Several members commented that the levels of utilization of capital and labor resources that had prevailed over the past couple of years would have been expected, on the basis of past historical patterns, to foster rising cost pressures and greater inflation. However, labor compensation gains had been subdued in relation to earlier cyclical experience, likely as a consequence of increased worker concerns about job security and job opportunities. Despite the continued low rate of unemployment and widespread anecdotal reports of tight labor markets across the country, there were only limited indications in national data that wage inflation might be increasing. Whether greater labor cost pressures would emerge in the context of the members' consensus forecast for economic activity was a critical issue in the outlook for prices, though it was noted that at least some of the rising costs were likely to be absorbed in shrinking profit margins. Even if greater price inflation were averted under that scenario, the members saw a substantial risk that if economic growth did not slow in line with their current forecasts, the resulting added pressures on resources would at some point translate into higher price inflation. Accordingly, the factors bearing on the outlook for resource use and inflation needed to be monitored with special care in this period.  With regard to inflation over the long run, the members agreed that it was essential for the Committee to continue to focus on reducing inflation over time because the achievement of an even less inflationary economic environment would foster a more productive economy and maximum sustainable economic expansion. The members acknowledged that as inflation diminished to very low levels, questions about the measurement of the overall price level presented difficult problems for assessing progress toward price stability. Some also observed that the precise level of average price inflation that might be compatible with the optimal functioning of the economy was an unsettled issue owing, for example, to potential rigidities in labor markets. Thus far, such rigidities had not impeded the economy from functioning at a very high level as inflation came down, and continued adaptation to even lower inflation rates was very likely. However, the Committee would need to pay careful attention to these potential problems as inflation fell further. For now, the members agreed that some additional progress in reducing inflation was very likely to improve the ultimate performance of the economy, and that it was particularly important at this juncture to resist firmly any tendency for inflation to worsen.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one of the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. These members also indicated that they preferred or could accept an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint. In their view, the most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation. Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation, While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures. However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand. Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative. While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seemed to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995. In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were likely to develop. A number of key economic data would become available over the next several weeks that would provide a much better basis for assessing the economy's momentum over the second half of the year and the outlook for inflation.  A differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising inflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of cost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion. There was little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports of appreciable wage pressures were increasing. Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen, the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve. Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy.  Members observed that an asymmetric directive would represent a shift from the symmetric directives that had been adopted over the past year but would be in keeping with their assessments of the risks of higher inflation. Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance. Some noted that a policy tightening action could tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening. Under the circumstances, the Committee would consult in some way before any policy tightening was undertaken.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity advanced considerably further in the second quarter, but increases in final demand showed some signs of moderation. Nonfarm payroll employment was up substantially in April and May; the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in May. Industrial production increased appreciably further in May, reflecting gains across a wide range of industries. Real consumer spending rose substantially on balance over April and May. Single-family housing starts fell considerably in May from a relatively high level in April. Orders and contracts point to some deceleration in spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures after a very rapid expansion earlier in the year. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April from its rate in the first quarter. Upward pressures on food and energy prices have led to somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index over recent months.  Most market interest rates have edged higher since the Committee meeting on May 21. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.  M2 declined in May, though partial data for June pointed to a rebound. Growth of M3 was relatively sluggish in May but also appears to have turned up in June. For the year through June, both aggregates are estimated to have grown at rates around the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance over recent months and has remained in the middle portion of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for short-run policy: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, McTeer, Meyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, and Yellen.  Vote against this action: Mr. Stern.  Mr. Stern dissented because he was convinced that a modestly more restrictive policy was warranted. In his view, the momentum of the economy and strains on capacity in labor and some other markets raised the possibility of an acceleration of inflation that would jeopardize the economic expansion. This concern aside, Mr. Stern also believed that current circumstances were favorable for policy action to reduce inflation further and thereby help to sustain the ongoing improvement in the economy.",199607,0,352,1996-07-31,-0.18,0.04,0.03,0.1,-0.02,0.4,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1996-07-03

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economic expansion had moderated somewhat recently. Growth in consumer spending appeared to be slowing, business purchases of equipment and structures were rising less vigorously, and higher mortgage rates were beginning to exert a restraining effect on housing construction. Business inventory accumulation had been quite modest, and production and employment were expanding less rapidly. Increases in labor compensation had been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, had remained on a fairly steady trend.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased relatively rapidly in July, though at a considerably slower pace than in the second quarter. Job growth in the services industry slowed sharply, and manufacturing employment declined appreciably after having risen somewhat in the second quarter. In contrast, the expansion in employment in wholesale and retail trade picked up slightly in July, and the number of jobs in construction continued to increase at about the second-quarter pace. The average workweek for private production or nonsupervisory workers fell considerably in July, to a level a little below its average for the second quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent.  Industrial production rose slightly further in July after three consecutive months of strong gains; manufacturing production expanded less rapidly, and electricity generation dropped sharply as a result of unseasonably cool weather. A substantial increase in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for most of the advance in manufacturing output. Elsewhere, the manufacture of office and computing equipment continued on its strong upward trend in July while the production of other business equipment slipped. The output of consumer goods edged lower after having risen slightly in May and June. The rate of utilization of total industrial capacity declined a little in July but remained at a relatively high level.  Retail sales weakened somewhat over June and July following several months of robust growth. Sales of motor vehicles were down in both months, and spending on other goods rose sluggishly on balance. Housing starts fell somewhat further in July, reflecting a sizable decline in single-family starts that more than offset a bounceback in multifamily starts. The drop in housing starts, coupled with lower sales of new and existing homes in June (latest data available), suggested that the rise in mortgage rates was exerting a damping effect on housing demand and homebuilding activity.  Growth in business spending on durable equipment and nonresidential structures had slowed after a very rapid expansion earlier in the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods were little changed in June after a sizable increase in May. Weakness in outlays for aircraft more than offset persisting strength in spending on office and computing equipment, and purchases of other types of equipment, notably communications and industrial equipment, continued to advance briskly. Nonresidential construction activity rebounded in June from an appreciable decline in May. The pace of office building picked up, and construction of other commercial and industrial structures posted healthy gains after May declines.  Business inventories increased by a modest amount in June after having contracted in May. In manufacturing, inventories continued to run off in June, reducing the sector's stock-sales ratio to near its historical low. Wholesale trade stocks also fell in June, and the inventory-sales ratio was in the lower portion of its range over recent years. Retail inventories rose in June; larger stocks at automotive dealers more than accounted for the increase. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector as a whole edged higher but remained at a relatively low level.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in June, but on a quarterly average basis the deficit widened in the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter. In June, the value of exports declined slightly, but the value of imports dropped by a considerably larger amount from a relatively high rate in May. Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter.  Price inflation remained moderate on balance in June and July, with declines in energy prices essentially offsetting increases in food prices. Over a somewhat longer horizon, consumer prices for nonfood, non-energy items increased slightly less in the twelve months ended in July than in the previous twelve-month period. Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy also increased more slowly in the twelve months ended in July. In contrast, growth in labor costs had picked up. The employment cost index for private industry workers advanced at a somewhat faster rate in the second quarter than in the first quarter or in the second half of 1995. Measured over the year ended in June, the index rose by a slightly larger amount than in the previous year.  [Return to top]  At its meeting on July 2-3, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  With economic growth moderating and inflation quiescent, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August. On balance, most other short-term market interest rates declined slightly, and intermediate- and long-term rates fell somewhat more, over the intermeeting period. In the days immediately following the meeting, rates rose sharply in response to incoming data, notably the employment report for June that market participants viewed as indicating increasing pressures on economic resources and labor costs. Subsequently, however, that rise was more than reversed when further data releases were interpreted as suggesting that the economic expansion might be slowing and that the upturn in labor compensation was mild. Equity prices also exhibited considerable volatility over the period since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, with major indexes of stock prices falling steeply through late July before recouping part to most of their losses in association with the bond market rally and favorable earnings reports.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The flow of information suggesting a slowing in U.S. economic growth and reduced prospects for a near-term tightening of Federal Reserve policy weighed against the dollar. On the other hand, the yen was bolstered by incoming data suggesting that the Japanese current account surplus was again widening, and the German mark benefited from the Bundesbank's inaction at a time when market participants were expecting a policy easing.  Growth of M2 and M3 moderated in July. Much of the slowdown in the expansion of M2 was associated with an unexpected decline in demand deposits, which had grown rapidly earlier in the year. With bank credit expanding sluggishly, the funding needs of banks were modest, and the slower growth of M2 showed through to M3. For the year through July, both aggregates were estimated to have increased at rates somewhat below the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to expand at a more moderate pace that would be in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect of the earlier run-up in equity prices on household wealth and the generally ample availability of credit were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to slow somewhat in response to the backup in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits. On balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period. Only modest fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Inflation recently had been lifted by adverse developments in energy markets and was projected to remain above the levels of recent years, given the high level of resource utilization, the effects of tight grain supplies on food prices, and a noticeable step-up in labor compensation reinforced by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage.  [Return to top]  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that on balance the information received since the July meeting, including anecdotal reports from around the nation, pointed to some slowing in the growth of economic activity from a very rapid pace during the spring. The extent of the slowing remained uncertain, and it was unclear at this juncture whether the expansion would slow sufficiently to contain pressures on labor and other producer resources. Nonetheless, broad measures of price inflation, adjusted to exclude their volatile food and energy components, did not exhibit any uptrend despite robust growth in economic activity this year and high levels of resource use. Indeed, some price measures suggested that inflation had trended lower through the second quarter. Moreover, there were no early signs of pressures or imbalances in the industrial sector. In labor markets, however, there were increasing indications of tightness that might at some point feed through to greater inflation. Upward wage adjustments were becoming more evident and increases in overall compensation had edged up, suggesting the possibility of further increases in labor costs at current or higher levels of labor utilization even before taking account of the effects of the rise in the minimum wage. Although increases in compensation might be moderated by greater productivity or absorbed for a time by lower profit margins, the risks seemed tilted toward increases in inflation at some point, especially if the growth of the economy continued to outstrip its potential and added to pressures on resources.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, members cited a variety of indications that economic growth was slowing from a very rapid pace, and they pointed to a number of factors that in their view should promote continued, though more moderate, expansion in economic activity. These included generally supportive financial conditions, relatively high levels of consumer confidence, and the absence of major imbalances in the economy. It was noted that much of the stimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had been provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending could be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied pent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in intermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. A key uncertainty in the outlook was the prospective behavior of inventories. Should the expansion in final demand fail to moderate to a sustainable pace, business firms would be likely to intensify their efforts to build their inventories, which currently were widely viewed as satisfactory or even relatively lean in relation to sales. While some buildup in inventories appeared to be occurring in the current quarter, developments that might lead to a sharp increase in inventory investment, such as shortages of various goods and materials and lengthening delays in securing deliveries, were not in evidence at this time. Accordingly, aggressive inventory accumulation remained an upside risk to the projected expansion but not one that was likely to materialize unless final demand were to exceed current forecasts by a significant margin.  In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members observed that increases in prices had remained remarkably subdued for an extended period in relation to measures of resource utilization, notably the rate of unemployment. Such behavior differed markedly from the historical experience under similar circumstances. One factor tending to hold down prices has been highly competitive markets--throughout the nation and internationally as well--that made it very difficult for business firms to raise prices. Another key factor, though one whose importance might now be starting to diminish, was the persistence of comparatively small increases in labor compensation, which remained appreciably below earlier norms in relation to levels of unemployment. This development appeared to reflect worker concerns about job security in a period of major business restructuring and downsizing activities as well as substantially reduced increases in benefit costs, notably those relating to health care.  In assessing whether a relatively favorable inflation performance was likely to continue, the members focused on a variety of issues. One was whether the expansion would moderate sufficiently to keep pressures on labor and other resources from intensifying. Another was whether a rate of unemployment in the vicinity of its current level would foster added wage pressures. Uncertainty also surrounded the extent to which further increases in labor compensation costs, should they materialize, would be passed through to higher prices. Improvements in productivity were likely to offset part of such increases, but how much remained an open question. In addition, profit margins were high, but the extent to which they might narrow to absorb increasing labor costs was difficult to predict. With regard to the outlook for wages, members observed that, though it was too early to reach a firm judgment, the acceleration of wage increases this year might well augur faster advances that were more in line with historical experience under essentially full employment conditions. Moreover, the tendency toward reduced increases in the costs of benefits might tend to dissipate, though some members commented that further economies in the provision of medical services might well be achievable for some period. On balance, the inflation risks in the outlook clearly seemed to be to the upside, with the potential for more inflation stemming from rising labor compensation costs augmented by a rise in the minimum wage and the prospect of higher food prices and perhaps energy prices over the next several quarters.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already was slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and they noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal evidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already under way. Consequently, all but one of the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. A number also commented that real interest rates were not unusually low, suggesting that any pickup in inflationary pressures, should that occur, would be modest and readily contained. One concern was that policy tightening at this point might generate an excessive reaction in financial markets, both because it was not generally expected and because it would represent a change in policy direction that might well lead to expectations of further policy tightening. Such a development could have serious adverse consequences for economic activity if the expansion was in fact already slowing to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace. These members therefore concluded that the prudent course at this point was to await further developments that would permit them to assess the possible need for some tightening with a higher degree of confidence. At the same time, it was emphasized that the Committee remained committed to a policy that would resist a rise in inflation; such a policy would entail moving in anticipation of greater price pressures and before they showed through to actual inflation. Accordingly, they also agreed on the desirability of a directive that remained biased toward possible tightening in the intermeeting period ahead. Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation. For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.  A differing view gave more weight to the risks of rising inflation. In this view, while there were uncertainties, the weight of the evidence suggested that a prompt policy action was needed to contain inflation and set the stage for further progress toward price stability. The possibility of an overreaction in financial markets to a tightening move could not be ruled out, but such a reaction was likely to be short-lived. More importantly, a prompt action would reduce the risk that inflation would worsen and pose difficult problems for monetary policy later.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity recently has moderated somewhat. Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly in July, the average workweek fell sharply, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production increased slightly in July after three months of strong gains. Real consumer spending weakened somewhat on balance over June and July following several months of robust growth. Housing starts fell somewhat further in July. Growth in spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures has slowed after a very rapid expansion earlier in the year. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter. Increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, has remained on a fairly steady trend.  Most short-term market interest rates have declined slightly while intermediate- and long-term rates have fallen somewhat more since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, 1996. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 moderated in July. For the year through July, both aggregates are estimated to have grown at rates somewhat below the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance over recent months and has remained in the middle portion of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, McTeer, Meyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, and Yellen.  Votes against this action: Mr. Stern.  Mr. Stern dissented because he believed that policy should become modestly more restrictive. He was concerned that, in the absence of a substantial and sustained improvement in productivity, the prevailing pattern of demand might engender an increase in inflationary pressures, and that such pressures would ultimately threaten the ongoing economic expansion. In Mr. Stern's judgment, it was prudent at this point to resist such a development in order to lay a foundation for the long-term health of the economy.",199608,0,353,1996-08-31,0.16,0.21,0.05,-0.02,0.39,0.34,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1996-08-20

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had moderated appreciably from an elevated second-quarter pace. Growth in consumer spending had slowed noticeably, and higher mortgage rates seemed to be exerting some modest restraint on housing demand. While business demand for durable equipment remained strong, spending on nonresidential structures had weakened a little. Business inventory accumulation appeared to have picked up, although the level of inventories remained modest in relation to sales. Employment and production had continued to post sizable gains in recent months, but the increases were somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year. Consumer price inflation, excluding its food and energy components, had edged lower this year despite somewhat larger increases in labor compensation.  Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly over July and August than it had in the second quarter; aggregate hours worked by private production workers also expanded at a slower pace over the two-month period. Job growth in the services industries was somewhat lower over the two months compared with that of the second quarter. Manufacturing employment changed little on balance over the July-August period, and construction hiring was down considerably in August after a July increase that was a little above the pace of the second quarter. The civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in August.  Industrial production also advanced somewhat less rapidly on average in July and August after having recorded strong gains in the previous few months; slower growth was evident in mining and utilities as well as in manufacturing. Smaller increases in the output of motor vehicles and parts accounted for part of the slowdown in the expansion of the manufacturing sector in August; in addition, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles remained sluggish, and the production of construction supplies declined significantly after having surged in the second quarter. Elsewhere in manufacturing, business equipment, notably its office and computing component, continued its robust expansion over July and August, and defense and space equipment extended the upturn that began in the second quarter. The rate of utilization of total industrial capacity was unchanged on balance from June to August and remained at a relatively high level.  Total retail sales rose slightly over July and August after having declined substantially in June. Decreased outlays at food stores, gas stations, and furniture and appliance stores in August were a little more than offset by a sharp pickup in sales at general merchandisers, apparel stores, and outlets for durable goods other than furniture and appliances. Housing starts rebounded in August from a July drop and for the two months were about unchanged on average from their second-quarter level; however, permits for single- family housing were unchanged in August and had fallen from their second-quarter level. Sales of existing homes weakened in June and July.  Demand for business equipment had remained strong in recent months. Shipments of nondefense capital goods declined in July, retracing part of a substantial second-quarter advance, but recent data on new orders pointed to further increases in business spending for durable equipment, notably office and computing equipment, in coming months. Nonresidential construction activity fell somewhat in July after having decreased a little in the second quarter.  Business inventory investment picked up sharply in July; most of the increase occurred at retail establishments. Manufacturing inventories rose somewhat, with the gain concentrated at manufacturers of producers' durable equipment. The stock-sales ratio for the sector was around its historical low. In the wholesale sector, inventories edged higher in July despite a substantial drop in stocks of farm products, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector fell to the low end of its range over recent years. Retail stocks expanded considerably at both automotive dealers and non-auto establishments in July. Inventory-sales ratios edged higher in most retail categories but they remained at relatively low levels.  Return to top  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July from its June level and also from its average rate for the second quarter. Despite one-time service payments related to the Olympics and larger inflows of imported oil, imports edged down in July from the sharply increased rate recorded for the second quarter; the latter largely reflected the strength of the U.S. economy during the first half of the year. Exports fell considerably more in July than did imports; in addition to decreased exports in such categories as consumer goods, aircraft and parts, automotive products, and other industrial supplies, part of the measured decline may have reflected residual seasonality in the data. Available information suggested that, on balance, the economies of the major foreign industrial countries had strengthened in recent months. In Japan, a mild second-quarter pause after very rapid first-quarter growth had been followed by renewed expansion. Economic activity in Germany had rebounded sharply in the second quarter from a first- quarter contraction, and further expansion appeared to be in train. Although economic growth had been sluggish in Canada and the United Kingdom in the second quarter, recent indicators suggested a pickup in activity in those countries as well. By contrast, France and Italy had experienced little, if any, growth since early in the year.  Consumer price inflation remained moderate on balance over July and August; declines in energy prices offset higher food prices. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices recorded a somewhat smaller advance over the twelve months ended in August than over the previous twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on net over July and August, and this index rose at a significantly slower pace over the twelve months ended in August than over the preceding twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rebounded in August, more than offsetting a small July decline. Over the year ended in August, this measure of labor costs increased considerably more than it had over the previous year.  At its meeting on August 20, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  With incoming information generally confirming that economic growth was moderating and that price inflation remained subdued, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate generally remained close to the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, but most other market interest rates exhibited considerable volatility and rose somewhat on balance over the intermeeting interval. Despite the rise in many market interest rates, equity prices rebounded over the period, and most major market indexes reached record highs.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period. The dollar's rise reflected in part the increase in U.S. long-term interest rates over the period. Declines in market rates abroad, both short- and long-term, also contributed to the dollar's strengthening. In Japan, newly released data led market participants to lower their assessments of the strength of that country's economic expansion and of the prospects of any near-term increase in official interest rates. In Germany, a reduction by the Bundesbank in its repo rate in late August and subsequent statements by Bank officials regarding possible additional declines in official rates appeared to foster market expectations that monetary policy might be eased further.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up in August from sluggish rates in July but remained below the average increases over the first half of the year. A continuing, rapid runoff in the liquid deposit components of these aggregates was offset in part by solid gains in retail money market funds and small time deposits, whose yields had not declined in step with decreases in market interest rates in early August. For the year through August, both aggregates grew at rates in the upper portions of their respective annual ranges. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting, which differed little from that for the previous meeting, suggested that the expansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential. Expansion of consumer spending was forecast to rebound from the sluggish third-quarter rate in light of strong income trends, the favorable effect of the rise in the stock market this year on household wealth, and the generally ample availability of credit. Homebuilding was anticipated to slow somewhat in response to this year's increase in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. The expansion of business investment in equipment and structures was projected to slow gradually in response to an easing of pressures on capacity, a prospective slackening in the growth of corporate cash flows, and the rise in long-term interest rates that had occurred this year. Only modest fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast period. Inflation, which had been boosted thus far in 1996 by adverse developments in food and energy markets, was projected to remain somewhat above that of recent years, given high levels of resource utilization and a noticeable step-up in labor compensation that would be reinforced by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the incoming information had been mixed since the August meeting but that on the whole it continued to suggest appreciable slowing in the economic expansion from a rapid and unsustainable pace in the second quarter. Data for many components of final demand, notably in the consumer sector, indicated that economic growth had moderated considerably in recent months. At the same time, supply-side data including employment and industrial production had remained relatively robust, contributing to uncertainty about underlying growth and suggesting that inventory accumulation had picked up during the summer. While the extent of the slowing in the overall expansion remained unclear, there were no indications of serious imbalances in the economy, and the members generally viewed further growth at a pace near that of the economy's potential as a likely prospect. They continued to be concerned, however, about the outlook for inflation, given the high level of production. In that regard, some commented that labor markets appeared to have tightened further in recent months and that wages were rising at a somewhat faster pace. Even so, the rate of price inflation had not picked up and the prospects were good that inflation would remain contained for some time. Whether the factors that had contributed to such a price performance would persist remained a key uncertainty in the economic outlook, and the members generally agreed that the risks continued to be tilted to some extent in the direction of rising price inflation over the forecast horizon.  In their discussion of the outlook for spending in key sectors of the economy, members commented that consumer expenditures were likely to pick up after their summer lull, though probably to a pace appreciably below that in the first half of this year. Favorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included strong gains in employment and income, the wealth effect stemming from the rise that had occurred in the value of financial assets, and generally buoyant consumer sentiment. The improvement in the consumer sector would tend to be restrained, however, by the increase in consumer debt burdens and the probable satisfaction of much of the pent-up demands for consumer durables during the current expansion. Business fixed investment likewise was expected to provide considerable further stimulus to the economy. Expenditures for business equipment, notably for office and computing equipment, were expected to expand substantially further, and recent weakness in nonresidential construction might well prove to be temporary, judging in part from anecdotal reports of considerable strength in commercial real estate markets in many areas. On the whole, however, the completion of numerous capital spending programs in conjunction with slower projected growth in overall demand could be expected to temper the expansion of business investment over coming quarters. In the housing sector, recent developments were somewhat mixed, but they suggested on balance that housing activity had held up better than expected in the light of increased mortgage interest rates. It was suggested in this regard that the retarding effects of higher rates on fixed-rate mortgage contracts were being blunted to some extent by shifts toward adjustable rate mortgages. Even so, and consistent with the softening already observed in a number of areas, residential construction was thought likely to drift lower over time.  The outlook for inventory investment, as is typically the case, was very difficult to assess. The moderation in the expansion of final demand in recent months, together with still relatively robust growth in employment and production, suggested that inventory investment had picked up since the second quarter. The strength in inventories in July tended to confirm that assessment. However, assuming moderate economic growth in line with current forecasts, there was no reason to anticipate substantial further strengthening in inventory investment over coming quarters. Indeed, the recent rebuilding of inventories after little or no growth earlier in the year made rapid expansion less likely going forward. The members acknowledged, nonetheless, that inventory developments needed to be monitored with care, including such indirect signs as rising pressures on the prices of intermediate goods and tightening delivery schedules that might provide incentives for a rapid buildup. With capacity utilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in inventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than- projected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures on resources and inflationary consequences for the economy.  In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members observed that the recent behavior of price inflation was a welcome though highly unusual development, given current pressures on resources. The statistical and anecdotal information provided evidence of increasingly tight labor markets that under similar conditions historically had been associated with considerable upward pressure on nominal labor compensation and, in turn, on prices. While wages, and probably total labor compensation, were rising more rapidly this year, the acceleration in the latter still appeared to be held down by worker insecurity and relatively subdued increases in the cost of benefits. Moreover, for a variety of reasons rising labor costs were not currently being passed through to prices, which by several key measures adjusted for their volatile food and energy components exhibited a steady or even a declining trend. Explanations tended to concentrate on the intense competition in many markets, which prevented firms from raising prices to absorb cost increases.  Competitive pressures also were compelling firms to curb cost increases through improvements in their productivity performance. Widespread reports suggested major gains in productivity in numerous industries, induced in recent years by business restructuring and related activities and by large capital investments that had introduced increasingly productive equipment. Although currently available measures of productivity for the economy as a whole showed only weak gains, sectoral disaggregation of the data gave reasons to question the productivity measurements. Productivity had increased fairly sharply in manufacturing, and the slowdown in overall productivity since 1973 had been concentrated in the service areas of the economy. Indeed, measured productivity in noncorporate businesses--largely services--had displayed a negative trend for many years. This result was implausible and suggested considerable error in estimating output and prices for many services. Consequently, it was likely that actual productivity growth was higher than the current measures indicated. By the same token, the rate of price inflation was lower than had been reported, consistent with the findings of a number of studies of distortions in published price data.  The implications for the inflation outlook were not clear- cut. The key question was how long the favorable price behavior would persist. Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time. However, many business contacts indicated that they would resist squeezes in profit margins, and continued acceleration in costs would eventually feed through to greater price inflation whatever the rate of productivity growth. The behavior of costs and the ability of businesses to pass along any greater increases over time would depend on the extent to which the expansion would slow and how much associated pressure there would be in labor and product markets. In this connection, some members observed that even if the expansion were to slow to a sustained pace around the rate of increase of the economy's potential, price inflation could well trend at least modestly higher at current levels of resource utilization. Others did not disagree that the odds might be tilted marginally in that direction, but they continued to believe that a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for resource use and, in turn, the relationship between a given degree of pressure on resources and overall price changes. In sum, assuming economic growth generally in line with their forecasts, the critical question for some was when and how much inflation would rise; many others were not persuaded of the inevitability of such an outcome.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they could support an unchanged policy stance and the retention of a bias toward restraint in the directive. The members generally agreed that while the risks were greater that price inflation would rise than that it would fall, higher inflation was not a foregone conclusion and most believed that the uncertainties in the outlook made it prudent to hold monetary policy on a steady course and await further developments. The expansion appeared to be slowing substantially and broad measures of prices, adjusted for fluctuations in their food and energy components, still indicated a steady or even slightly declining inflation trend. In these circumstances, the Committee could wait for more information on the momentum of the expansion and the degree of pressure on resources and its implications for inflation. A delay in adjusting monetary policy was facilitated by its current positioning, which did not appear to be far from a desirable longer-term stance because any pickup in inflation was likely to be relatively small and gradual, and was further supported by the possibility of an excessive reaction in financial markets to a change in the direction of policy. A few members indicated that they could vote for some slight tightening in policy, although they did not feel any urgency about such a move. They observed that the decision was a close one for them, and in light of the uncertainties that were involved, they were willing to join the majority and wait for further evidence bearing on the outlook for inflation. With regard to possible intermeeting adjustments to policy, the members agreed that retaining an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint would be consistent with their assessments of the inflation risks in the economy. Accordingly, information suggesting that the odds on higher inflation had risen should be met with a prompt policy firming.  A differing view focused on the desirability of a prompt move toward restraint to curb what were seen as growing inflationary pressures in the economy. Tight labor markets were likely to exert continuing upward pressure on labor costs, barring unexpected weakness in the economy, and at some point those costs would begin to be passed through to prices. In the circumstances, it was important for policy to be forward-looking and to move promptly to head off intensifying inflationary pressures. Potentially, waiting could require more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk the credibility of the System's anti-inflation policy.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they could accept a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has moderated appreciably from an elevated second-quarter pace. Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly over July and August than in the second quarter, while the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in August. Industrial production increased somewhat less rapidly on average in July and August than in the prior few months. Total retail sales rose slightly over July and August after having declined substantially in June. Housing starts in July and August were unchanged on average from their second-quarter level. Demand for business equipment has remained strong, while spending on nonresidential structures has changed little on balance in recent months. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July from its average in the second quarter. Increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, excluding its food and energy components, has edged lower.  Most market interest rates have risen somewhat on balance since the Committee meeting on August 20, 1996. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up in August, but they continued to expand at rates below those in the first half of the year. For the year through August, both aggregates are estimated to have grown at rates in the upper portions of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance over recent months and has remained in the middle portion of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, McTeer, Meyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, and Yellen.  Vote against this action: Mr. Stern.  Mr. Stern dissented because he believed that a modestly more restrictive policy was appropriate. In his view, historical precedents suggested that prolonged periods of taut labor markets were eventually associated with rising inflation. Given prevailing pressures on resources, especially labor, Mr. Stern was concerned about the distinct risk of an acceleration of inflation. Should this acceleration occur, he believed it would prove disruptive to the favorable performance of the economy, and he preferred to begin to address this risk promptly.",199609,0,354,1996-09-30,0.31,0.06,0.04,0.02,0.42,0.26,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1996-09-24

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited information available for the period since then indicated continued moderate expansion. A marked softening in the growth of consumer expenditures accounted for much of the slowing in the third quarter, but slight weakening in housing demand, net exports, and federal purchases of goods and services also exerted retarding effects. On the other hand, a sizable increase in inventory investment, greater strength in business demand for durable equipment, and an upturn in spending on nonresidential construction helped foster moderate further economic growth in the third quarter. Employment posted sizable increases over the third quarter and rose substantially further in October, but on balance the gains were somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year. Industrial production had weakened somewhat recently. Consumer price inflation had picked up this year because of larger increases in food and energy prices. Increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, also had been somewhat larger this year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in October after a small rise in September; private payroll growth had moderated on balance since midyear but nevertheless had remained substantial. In October, job gains were large in services industries; construction employment registered another moderate gain; and manufacturing payrolls edged up after a sizable September loss. The civilian unemployment rate in October was unchanged at 5.2 percent.  Industrial production appeared to have declined appreciably in October after having grown briskly on balance over earlier months of the year. Much of the slackening in October was due to work stoppages in the motor vehicles industry, but the output of other industries also apparently decreased slightly on balance. The drop in production was accompanied by a slight decline in capacity utilization in manufacturing.  Total retail sales rose appreciably in September after having changed little on balance over July and August; for the third quarter as a whole, total retail sales edged higher after having expanded briskly in the first half of the year. September sales totals were boosted by strong spending at automotive dealers, food stores, and nondurable goods outlets. However, expenditures for furniture, appliances and other non-auto durable goods fell, and apparel sales weakened a little further. Housing starts declined in September from the unusually high level recorded in August and permits moved lower for a second straight month. Home sales were mixed, with sales of new homes well sustained in September while those of existing homes continued on a downtrend.  Growth of business fixed investment surged in the third quarter. Outlays for durable equipment picked up sharply, and new orders for business equipment remained on an upward trend. Sales of computers and communications equipment increased rapidly, but demand for other capital goods was up only slightly during the quarter. In the transportation sector, expenditures on motor vehicles and aircraft strengthened while sales of heavy trucks continued to drift lower. Spending on nonresidential structures more than reversed a second- quarter decline; however, incoming data on contracts pointed to a continuation of the pattern of somewhat slower growth recorded thus far in 1996.  The pace of inventory investment picked up markedly after midyear, but inventory-sales ratios nonetheless remained relatively low. In manufacturing, inventories rose moderately in the third quarter, more than offsetting a small rundown in stocks in the previous quarter; stock-shipments ratios for most industries remained near the low end of their recent ranges. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined sharply in September after having edged down in the previous two months, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector fell to the low end of its range over recent years. At the retail level, substantial inventory accumulation occurred over the July-August period (latest data). Although stock-sales ratios rose slightly, inventories remained relatively well aligned with sales.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter. Exports declined appreciably over the July-August period, with most of the decrease occurring in nonmonetary gold and aircraft. Imports rose only marginally on balance over the two months. The limited available information suggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third quarter.  Consumer price inflation had picked up on balance this year as a result of sizable increases in food and energy prices. Over August and September, however, increases in food prices were offset by a net decline in energy prices, and overall consumer prices rose more moderately. For the twelve months ended in September, the advance in consumer prices of items other than food and energy was a little smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, price inflation also was moderate over August and September despite appreciable increases in the prices of food and energy items; producer prices of items other than food and energy rose considerably less over the twelve months ended in September than they had over the previous twelve months. Growth in the employment cost index for private industry workers slowed considerably in the third quarter after having trended up over the first two quarters of the year; however, this measure of labor compensation was up slightly over the twelve months ended in September compared with the previous twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in October, but the twelve-month rise in this index through October was a bit larger than the increase over the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on September 24, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  With incoming information continuing to suggest moderate economic growth and subdued price inflation, open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate generally remained close to the level expected with an unchanged policy stance. Market participants had anticipated some tightening of monetary policy at the September 24 meeting, and the announcement of an unchanged policy led to an immediate decline in interest rates, with the larger decreases occurring at the shorter end of the yield curve. Interest rates, especially those at intermediate and longer maturities, dropped further over the remainder of the period in response to information indicating that price and labor cost pressures were lower than market participants had expected. Equity markets responded to the declines in interest rates as well as to favorable earnings reports, and most major indexes reached record highs.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated slightly on balance over the intermeeting period. Interest rates in the foreign industrial countries fell somewhat less on average than did U.S. interest rates. The dollar changed little against the German mark and most other major continental European currencies, but it rose against the yen as prospects for a significant supplemental budget package in Japan waned in the aftermath of the recent elections in that country. The dollar declined against the pound sterling in response to the release of favorable data on the U.K. economy as well as an unexpected increase in the Bank of England's minimum lending rate.  M2 grew at a slower pace in September and October than it had over earlier months of the year; the weaker expansion resulted from a continuing rapid runoff in its liquid deposit components. Nonetheless, M2 was estimated to have grown for the year through October at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's annual range. By contrast, M3 expanded at a substantially faster rate in September and October than it had earlier in the year, reflecting a surge in its large time deposit and other managed liability components to meet business demand for bank loans. For the year through October, M3 was estimated to have grown at a rate around the top of its annual range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would continue at a rate close to, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to rebound in the current quarter and subsequently to expand at a moderate pace in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect on household wealth of the rise that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to decline slightly further in response to the previous backup in residential mortgage rates but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and a generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits. On balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period. A slight degree of fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Continued pressure on resources, especially in labor markets, pointed to a likely underlying tendency toward higher inflation over the projection period; however, it was expected that improved supply conditions in food and energy markets, as well as planned technical changes, would damp increases in the consumer price index relative to the elevated 1996 rate.  In the Committee's discussion, members commented that most recent developments bearing on the outlook for economic growth and inflation had been favorable. The information on economic activity since the September meeting had confirmed earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to the economy's potential. The outlook remained subject, as usual, to considerable uncertainty, but many of the members observed that underlying trends in key sectors of the economy along with generally supportive financial conditions seemed consistent with further moderate economic expansion. In this regard, several focused on what they saw as the promising prospects for a rebound in the growth of consumer expenditures following weak expansion in the third quarter; the pickup would help sustain moderate economic growth over the nearer term despite some anticipated retrenchment in inventory accumulation. With respect to the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that despite widespread indications of tight labor markets, the increase in wages had been muted and somewhat less than anticipated, and there was no broad evidence of rising price inflation. Indeed, many major measures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993. Looking ahead, views differed to some extent regarding the most likely course for inflation. Several members indicated that, while recent developments were encouraging, they continued to see the risks as tilted toward some rise, even assuming that the expansion settled into a pattern of growth near the economy's potential as they anticipated and resource utilization remained near current levels; other members felt that the risks surrounding the forecasts for both economic growth and price inflation had become more evenly balanced, but more evidence was needed before a firm judgment could be reached.  In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members said that they anticipated a pickup in consumer spending from its much reduced rate of growth in the third quarter. While the factors relating to the prospects for consumer expenditures did not all point toward greater strength, members tended to focus on those favoring an upturn. These included persisting growth in employment and incomes and clearly upbeat consumer sentiment as evidenced by recent surveys and anecdotal reports. Financial factors also seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in consumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had occurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability of credit to most households. Supporting evidence included anecdotal reports from retailers in a numbers of areas who were experiencing sizable gains in sales and seemed optimistic about the outlook for the upcoming holiday season. Among the developments that would tend to limit growth in consumer spending, members emphasized the level of consumer indebtedness which had strained the liquidity of many households. The growth of consumer credit was now exhibiting a moderating trend, possibly pointing to restrained spending by many households because of already heavy debt service burdens and generally tightening credit standards for consumer loans. Other negative factors cited in the outlook for consumer expenditures were the possibility of a correction in the stock market and the probable satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables. In balancing these conflicting influences, the members generally concluded that a pickup in the growth of consumer spending to a moderate pace was a likely prospect for this critical sector of the economy.  Business fixed investment was expected to provide further but diminished impetus to the expansion. This view took account of the continued availability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms but also of expectations of a more moderate growth trend in sales and the substantial buildup that had already occurred in stocks of equipment and structures. With regard to the latter, some overbuilding of commercial and other structures characterized conditions in a number of areas. Nonetheless, members reported considerable nonresidential building activity in several parts of the country, and nationwide such activity was expected to help sustain modest growth in overall nonresidential construction in coming quarters.  Recent data, supported by anecdotal reports from several though not all parts of the country, suggested that residential building activity was slowing somewhat, apparently in lagged response to earlier increases in mortgage interest rates. However, in the context of the partial reversal recently of the previous increases in mortgage rates and sustained growth in employment and incomes, the housing sector was viewed as likely to exert only a minor constraint on overall economic activity over the forecast horizon. Another somewhat negative factor in the outlook for economic activity was the prospect of some widening in the nation's trade deficit over the projection period.  Fiscal policy currently remained on a mildly restrictive course, but the range of potential developments was especially wide, injecting an element of considerable uncertainty in the economic outlook. Legislation affecting the federal budget could have marked beneficial or adverse effects not only directly on spending and incomes but also on business and consumer confidence and financial markets.  The growth of nonfarm business inventories in the third quarter had exceeded earlier expectations, but members commented that the sizable rise appeared to have been largely voluntary and the overall level of inventories was still historically low in relation to sales. Against this background, inventory accumulation was likely to continue but at a slower pace in the current quarter. Beyond the near term, inventory investment was expected to become a more neutral factor in the performance of the economy, given the absence of incentives to build stocks relative to sales in a period of moderate growth in projected demand. The members recognized, however, that the prospective behavior of inventories remained subject to substantial uncertainties.  In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members again focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which rising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to higher prices. The statistical and anecdotal information generally continued to point to tight labor markets and to a somewhat faster rise in labor compensation costs this year. Even so, the increases in such costs were still falling short of those that would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience under similar labor market conditions. Moreover, the advance in the overall employment cost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some extent, was appreciably below expectations. At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets. Indeed, with the notable exception of the overall consumer price index, the rate of inflation as measured by various broad price indexes had tended to ease marginally or at worst to stabilize over the past two years. Prices of farm commodities and industrial materials had declined considerably recently.  Despite the recent encouraging reports on labor compensation and prices, the members agreed that the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed and several continued to view slightly higher inflation as a likely if not inevitable prospect. Much would depend, of course, on the strength of the economic expansion and the associated degree of pressure on resources, notably in labor markets which appeared to have comparatively little slack in relation to other producer resources. It was suggested in this regard that restrained increases in labor compensation in comparison with historical experience probably were a transitory phenomenon, though one could not predict when a more normal relationship would re-emerge. A related concern was whether the tightness in labor markets would ease sufficiently and quickly enough to prevent inflation pressures from escalating significantly. Some members mentioned a number of favorable factors in the outlook for inflation that tended to attenuate such concerns, such as reduced pressures on food prices as a result of better-than-expected harvests and improved supply conditions in markets for energy. Relatively restrained monetary growth in recent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued inflationary pressures. Moreover, the view was advanced that recent developments in bond markets could be read as suggesting some decrease in inflationary expectations. On balance, while the members expressed varying degrees of concern that tight labor markets and attendant increases in wages might at some point lead to rising price inflation, they agreed that there was little or no evidence of such a development at this point and the outlook was far from certain.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members indicated that they could support an unchanged policy stance and the retention of a bias toward restraint in the directive. The slowing of the expansion to a sustainable pace near the economy's growth potential and the recent surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks of strengthening price pressures and provided the Committee with a desirable opportunity to pause and observe further developments bearing on the course of economic activity and inflation. Indeed, to the extent that inflation expectations had declined recently, short-term interest rates, which had changed little in nominal terms, had edged higher in real terms, implying slightly greater monetary restraint and reducing the odds that inflation would pick up.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to retain the current bias toward restraint. Several viewed such a bias as desirable because they continued to believe that the risks remained tilted, at least to some extent, toward rising inflation over time. In the circumstances an asymmetric directive would best reflect their views even if, as seemed likely, intermeeting developments did not prompt a policy tightening adjustment. Other members commented that a shift to a symmetric directive might be viewed as more consistent with the apparently diminished inflationary pressures. They agreed, however, that such a shift would be premature in the currently uncertain environment and might signal, inaccurately, that the Federal Reserve was less concerned about the possibility of a a modest upward trajectory in price inflation.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and retaining a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and relatively strong expansion in M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited available information indicates continued moderate expansion more recently. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.2 percent in October. Industrial production, which continued to rise in the third quarter, appears to have declined in October owing in important measure to work stoppages in the motor vehicles industry. Total retail sales turned up in September after slumping earlier in the summer. Housing starts fell in September from the exceptionally high level registered in August. Outlays for business equipment were strong in the third quarter and new orders continued to trend upward; business spending on nonresidential structures posted a moderate advance. Inventory investment was substantial in the third quarter, but inventory-sales ratios remained relatively low. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened considerably in July-August from its average rate in the second quarter. Increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, have trended up this year; consumer price inflation also has picked up this year, owing to larger increases in food and energy prices.  Market interest rates have moved lower since the Committee meeting on September 24, 1996, with the largest declines occurring in intermediate- and long-term maturities. In foreign exchange markets, the trade- weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 in September and October remained below its pace in the first half of the year, while expansion of M3 was substantially higher over those two months. For the year through October, M2 is estimated to have grown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's annual range, and M3 at a rate around the top of its range. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance over recent months and has remained in the middle portion of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and relatively strong expansion in M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Consumer spending had rebounded from its summer lull, but housing demand was somewhat weaker on balance and the growth of business spending on durable equipment had slowed from a very rapid pace. Although inventory investment had picked up, stocks in most sectors had remained well aligned with sales. Both industrial production and employment had recorded sizable advances. Increases in labor compensation had trended up this year, and consumer price inflation also had picked up, but the faster rise in overall consumer prices owed entirely to larger increases in food and energy prices.  Private-sector demand for labor remained solid in November. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in November after an October surge, and the average workweek of private production or nonsupervisory workers retraced more than half of its October decline. Service industries recorded another large gain in employment despite a sharp drop in payrolls at help-supply firms, and the number of jobs in retail trade expanded further in November after a steep rise in October. In the goods-producing sector, employment in construction and manufacturing rose moderately. The civilian unemployment rate increased slightly, to 5.4 percent, in November.  Industrial production rose sharply in November after a small October decline. A rebound in motor vehicle assemblies from the disruptive effects of work stoppages accounted for much of the increase in production in November, but output from utilities also surged in response to unusually cool weather. The production of nondurable consumer goods and business equipment other than motor vehicles also was up significantly in November while the manufacture of consumer durables and defense and space equipment decreased further. Reflecting the strong advance in production, the utilization of total industrial capacity picked up considerably in November.  Consumer spending increased appreciably on balance in recent months after a lackluster performance in the summer. Total retail sales fell in November but nonetheless were considerably above their average in the third quarter. The November decline reflected weakness in auto sales; retail spending on other items, notably durable goods, rose significantly further. Spending on services picked up in October (latest data) following a relatively weak third quarter. Housing starts rebounded in November after declining in September and October. Single-family starts in November were a little below the average pace of previous months in the year while multifamily starts surged to a level not seen since late 1990. By contrast, sales of both new and existing homes dropped again in October (latest data).  Growth of business fixed investment appeared to have slowed to a moderate pace in the fourth quarter after a sharp rise in the previous quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell in October, reversing a sizable September gain; however, recent data on orders pointed to further increases in business spending for equipment, especially for communications equipment where shipments already were at a high level. Business investment in transportation equipment evidently weakened, as sales of heavy trucks remained sluggish and production shortfalls held back fleet sales of light vehicles. By contrast, nonresidential construction continued to expand at a solid rate in October, with building activity particularly strong in the office, other commercial, institutional, and industrial categories.  Business inventory investment picked up sharply in October from the slow September pace, but total stocks remained at a low level in relation to sales. Most of the October increase occurred at the wholesale level; inventories of farm products turned up sharply after months of sizable drawdowns, and petroleum stocks were built up from unseasonably low levels. Despite the October rise, the ratio of wholesale inventories to shipments remained at the lower end of its range over recent years. In manufacturing, stocks increased at a pace in line with shipments, and the aggregate inventory-shipments ratio stayed at a very low level. Retail inventories were up moderately in October. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector was unchanged and remained in the middle of its range over recent years.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was somewhat larger in September than in August; exports decreased slightly in September while imports were little changed. For the third quarter, the deficit widened substantially from its rate in the second quarter as exports fell and imports rose moderately. Nearly all of the decline in exports reflected lower sales of aircraft and gold. Increases in imports were widespread but they were largely offset by declines in imports of gold and semiconductors. Economic growth picked up in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the third quarter, but available indicators generally suggested some slowing of growth in the fourth quarter. In Japan, by contrast, economic activity had been sluggish in the third quarter but appeared to have picked up more recently.  Consumer price inflation in October and November was lifted slightly by sizable advances in energy prices and, to a lesser degree, increases in food prices; however, consumer prices for items other than food and energy rose modestly during the two months. The rise in core consumer prices over the twelve months ended in November was somewhat smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months, although the total index registered a bigger advance as a result of larger increases in food and energy prices. At the producer level, prices of finished energy goods rose sharply in October and November while prices of finished foods advanced less rapidly. Excluding food and energy, prices of finished goods edged lower on balance over October and November, and in the twelve months ended in November, these prices rose substantially less than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were up considerably in November after edging down in October. The twelve-month rise in this index was somewhat larger than the advance over the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on November 13, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and relatively strong expansion of M3 over coming months.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. However, the federal funds rate tended to average a little above the level expected with an unchanged policy stance in apparent response to scattered operating problems and occasional unexpectedly large clearing needs at banks. Other short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes since the November 13 meeting; Treasury bill rates drifted lower, partly because of heightened demands for safety and liquidity as asset markets became more volatile during the period, while year-end pressures boosted rates on private instruments with maturities in early 1997. At longer maturities, yields drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming data that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and inflation subdued, but they rebounded late in the period in response to the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding the sustainability of current domestic asset prices. Despite these concerns, most major indexes of equity prices advanced further on balance.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly over the intermeeting period. The dollar rose even more against the German mark and the French franc amid increased market apprehension that the European Monetary Union's common currency, the euro, will not be as strong a currency as the mark. The dollar also might have been boosted by statements by French and German officials that suggested the dollar was undervalued against their currencies.  Expansion of the broad monetary aggregates was relatively strong in November. Growth of M2 picked up, reflecting a sharp increase in demand deposits and smaller runoffs in other checkable deposits. Inflows to retail money market funds remained substantial. Expansion of M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October as growth in business demands for credit slowed and banks reduced their reliance on large time deposits and other managed liability components. For the year through November, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's annual range, and M3 at a rate a little above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded moderately on balance over recent months and remained in the middle portion of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to increase at a rate generally in line with the anticipated rise in disposable income; the favorable effects on household wealth of the advance that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance the damping effects of continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings, the security of their jobs, and the extent of their debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits. Fiscal policy and the external sector were expected to continue to exert small restraining influences on economic activity over the projection period. Consumer price inflation, excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the price index, was forecast to rise slightly over 1997 and 1998 in the context of anticipated high resource use and an accompanying appreciable pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would be augmented by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage. Somewhat larger increases would have been projected in consumer price inflation in the absence of anticipated technical measurement changes to the index.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members commented that the information received during the relatively short interval since the previous meeting had not materially altered either their assessment that the economy was performing quite favorably or their forecasts of further growth at a pace averaging near the economy's potential. The economy currently displayed fairly solid underpinnings, with few imbalances of the kind that historically had tended to create problems. Against the background of generally supportive financial conditions and a high degree of consumer and business confidence, further economic growth was thought likely to be sustained by appreciable increases in consumer spending and business investment. The overall pace of the expansion was expected to be restrained to an extent, however, by declining federal government outlays for goods and services and ongoing weakness in net exports.  Despite the prospects for moderate economic growth, members observed that the risks on inflation still seemed to be tilted toward some rise over time. Measures of core inflation had displayed little trend and even some decline over the past year. However, wage increases had moved higher over that period, a development suggesting the possibility that labor markets might be tighter than could be sustained over the long term. At some point accelerating labor compensation costs, were they to continue, likely would spill over into higher inflation. Such an outcome remained subject to a great deal of uncertainty, however, in light of the relatively benign behavior in recent years of both wages and prices in comparison with historical experience at prevailing levels of resource utilization.  In the Committee's discussion of developments in major sectors of the economy bearing on the outlook for business activity, members noted that consumer spending had picked up as expected after a lull during the summer months. Survey data and anecdotal reports suggested that consumer confidence was currently high, and there were widespread indications of robust retail sales during the early weeks of the holiday season, though holiday sales were always difficult to read at this stage. Thus far, however, sales of motor vehicles had not strengthened to the extent that was anticipated after full production was restored following a work stoppage at a major manufacturer. Members cited a number of factors--the rise in consumer debt burdens, tightening consumer credit standards, continued worker concerns about job security, and the satisfaction of earlier pent-up demands--that were tending to inhibit the growth in consumer spending and perhaps helped to explain why the sharp increases in stock market wealth had not been accompanied by stronger growth in such spending. The behavior of the stock market injected an additional note of uncertainty into the forecast for consumer spending and the economy more generally. The rise over recent years had been extraordinary and had brought market valuations to fairly high levels relative to earnings and dividends. In these circumstances, the members recognized the need to monitor with special care price movements in the stock market and asset markets more generally for their implications for consumer and other spending. On balance, favorable employment and income conditions seemed likely to foster a level of consumer spending that would provide key support for sustained economic expansion.  The members anticipated smaller though still sizable gains in business fixed investment over the year ahead. Slowing growth in profit levels and cash flows was likely to retard spending for many types of business equipment, but favorable prices, advancing technology, and readily available financing probably would continue to foster rapid expansion in office, computing, and communications equipment. The outlook for nonresidential construction remained uneven across the country, but such construction seemed likely to edge higher on balance over the next several quarters. Members noted in this regard that the construction of office buildings had strengthened in a number of urban areas. Business inventories currently seemed on the whole to be at desired and sustainable levels in relation to sales. In the circumstances, inventory accumulation was projected to remain moderate and, barring unexpected surges or declines in final sales, was not likely to be a significant factor affecting the course of the economy.  The recent information on residential construction was mixed. Weakness in late summer and early fall evidently reflected the effects of earlier increases in mortgage interest rates, but some measures of housing activity in November indicated unexpected strength. In addition, reports from around the country pointed to uneven conditions ranging from further strength to some emerging weakness in regional housing markets. On balance, the statistical and anecdotal information was interpreted, by some members at least, as consistent with a tendency for housing activity to stabilize. In this view, a level of housing construction somewhat below the peak reached earlier in 1996 was likely to be sustained, buoyed in part by the recent decline in mortgage interest rates and the continuing rise in consumer incomes and favorable consumer sentiment.  A modest degree of fiscal restraint seemed likely over the next two fiscal years. Some members expressed optimism with regard to the prospects for an agreement between the President and the Congress that would provide a basis for reaching a balanced budget by the year 2002. Such an agreement would need to include controversial constraints on the growth of entitlements, but its achievement would have favorable effects on financial markets and on business and consumer sentiment more generally, thereby tending to offset at least in part any direct effects of reduced federal spending on aggregate demand.  Members anticipated that the external sector of the economy would continue to exert some restraint on domestic economic activity, though perhaps to a lesser extent than over the past year. In particular, the growth of U.S. exports was expected to accelerate somewhat in association with some strengthening on average in the economies of the nation's key trading partners. The economic recovery in Mexico from its earlier financial crisis was already providing a considerable boost to exports from some parts of the United States.  Inflation had remained subdued, but the members continued to view the risks as tilted toward increases in the future. Labor compensation costs clearly were rising at a faster pace in the context of persistently tight labor markets, and an upturn in core price inflation seemed quite possible at some point in the absence of some easing of pressures in labor markets. However, the members recognized that the increase in wage inflation had been significantly less than would have been anticipated on the basis of historical relationships with labor market conditions, and price performance also had been more favorable than those relationships would have suggested. In the circumstances, there was a good deal of uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation, including the potential degree of utilization in labor markets, the associated pressures on labor costs, and the ability of firms to pass higher labor costs into prices in markets that generally continued to be described as highly competitive. With the economy operating in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential, relatively minor differences in overall economic growth could have a significant effect over time on whether inflation would tend to trend up or down.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance while also retaining a bias toward restraint in the directive. An unchanged policy was warranted by the quite satisfactory performance of the economy and inflation and the uncertainties surrounding the outlook. Thus, while the longer-term risks might point toward rising inflation, there were reasonable prospects that inflation would remain contained, and any pickup in inflation, should it occur, was likely to be limited at least for a time. In the circumstances, the members concluded that watchful waiting remained the prudent course for policy as they continued to assess ongoing developments. Because the risks of waiting did not appear to be substantial at this juncture, anticipatory tightening was not yet called for.  In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation. Accordingly, while they were not suggesting that policy should be especially quick to react to incoming information over the intermeeting period, they did view the next policy move as more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. In this connection, some members emphasized that it would be especially important for the Committee to act promptly to counter any tendency for price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with relatively strong expansion in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in November, although the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production rose sharply in November, in part because of a rebound in motor vehicle assemblies that had been depressed earlier by work stoppages. Consumer spending has posted appreciable gains over recent months after a summer lull. Housing starts rebounded in November after declining in September and October. Business fixed investment appears to be growing moderately after a sharp rise in the third quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the third quarter from its rate in the second quarter. Increases in labor compensation have trended up this year, and consumer price inflation also has picked up owing to larger increases in food and energy prices.  Short-term market interest rates have registered mixed changes since the Committee meeting on November 13, 1996, while long-term yields have risen slightly. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen slightly over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 picked up in November, while expansion of M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October. For the year through November, M2 is estimated to have grown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's annual range, and M3 at a rate a little above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded moderately on balance over recent months and has remained in the middle portion of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with relatively strong expansion in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of the economy had strengthened markedly in the fourth quarter of 1996. To a large extent the gain in final demand during the quarter reflected a surge in exports, but consumer spending also increased substantially after having risen at a much reduced pace in the third quarter. Despite some slowing in the growth of business fixed investment and some easing in housing activity, the overall economy had expanded briskly as reflected in data on production and employment. The tightness in labor markets had persisted and was evidenced by some continued acceleration in labor compensation in the fourth quarter. There was no discernible change in the underlying trend in price inflation, although a spurt in energy prices had resulted in faster increases in overall consumer and producer prices than in the third quarter.  Private payroll employment rose appreciably further in December after recording sizable increases over October and November. The gains remained widespread among employment categories and continued to be led by large advances in the services and trade industries. Aggregate hours of private production workers and the average workweek edged higher in the fourth quarter. The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in December at 5.3 percent, its average level for the second half of the year.  Industrial production increased sharply in November and December. The gains in December were widely distributed across manufacturing industries, but were held down by a steep decline in the output of utilities after a surge in November. The production of aircraft and parts extended a strong uptrend. The utilization of total manufacturing capacity rose considerably further in December, to a level slightly above its long-term average.  Consumer spending registered a sizable increase over the fourth quarter after having grown little during the summer. In December total nominal retail sales rose considerably following a small decline in November. The December increases were spread across all major categories except for some further decline in sales of building materials and supplies. The most recent data on services expenditures pointed to moderate advances in October and November. Surveys indicated that consumer confidence had remained elevated in late 1996 and early 1997.  Housing starts fell appreciably in December, evidently reflecting unusually adverse weather conditions in several parts of the country, and were down somewhat for the fourth quarter as a whole. The declines were concentrated in single-family units. Permits for new home construction were little changed in December but edged lower for the fourth quarter as a whole. Available data indicated a somewhat slower pace of sales of new and existing homes in the fourth quarter.  Growth of business fixed investment moderated considerably in the fourth quarter after advancing sharply in the previous quarter. The slowdown reflected a small decline in spending on producer durable equipment that was more than offset by an apparent surge in outlays for nonresidential structures. Growth in spending on office, computing, and communications equipment slowed somewhat from the third-quarter pace but remained on a steep uptrend. Business investment in transportation equipment was weak in the fourth quarter, as sales of heavy trucks fell further and work stoppages at a major manufacturer prompted cuts in fleet auto sales in October and November.  Business inventory investment picked up somewhat on average in October and November, with most of the increase occurring in manufacturing. Trade inventories increased moderately on balance over the two-month period. Reflecting considerable strength in shipments and sales, however, inventory-sales ratios for most industries and trade groupings edged lower from their third-quarter levels.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed considerably in October and November from its rate in the third quarter. Nearly all the improvement was accounted for by a very large increase in exports of goods and services. The rise was spread among all major trade categories except for automotive products. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have continued to expand at a moderate rate on average in the fourth quarter. Available indicators suggested relatively strong economic performances in Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom and slower growth in the major continental European countries. Further expansion was reported for several large Latin American and some Asian economies.  Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends. Overall consumer prices had continued under upward pressure in November and December, boosted by large advances in energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose modestly over the two months and increased less over the twelve months ending in December than over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, a similar pattern prevailed in prices of finished goods, and there was no evidence of increased price pressures at earlier stages of production. Worker compensation as measured by the employment cost index (ECI) and average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose considerably further during the closing months of 1996. For the year, both measures were up appreciably more than in 1995, though much of the acceleration in the ECI occurred in the first half of the year.  At its meeting on December 17, 1996, the Committee issued a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions to reflect a consensus among the members that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be toward some tightening than toward easing. In this regard, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing of the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period continued to be directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate rose briefly in response to year-end pressures, but it otherwise tended to remain close to the 5-1/4 percent level expected with an unchanged policy stance. Other short-term interest rates generally were unchanged to slightly higher over the intermeeting period. Rates on intermediate- and long-term securities edged higher on balance in reaction to incoming data on economic activity that were on the firm side of market expectations; the increases in such rates appeared to be tempered, however, by favorable market reactions to new data on wages and prices. The generally positive news on economic growth and inflation along with favorable reports on earnings appeared to reinforce the optimism of equity market investors, and major indexes of stock prices increased markedly further over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose substantially over the intermeeting period. The rise, which was most pronounced against the Japanese yen and continental European currencies, appeared to reflect market perceptions of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the United States and a risk of faltering growth in the other countries. The dollar appreciated less against sterling and declined somewhat against the Canadian dollar in apparent response to expectations of relative strength in the economies of those countries.  After growing at a considerably faster rate in the fourth quarter, M2 and M3 apparently increased at a more moderate but still brisk pace in January. The expansion of both aggregates likely was boosted by strong income growth, and the relatively rapid expansion of M3 reflected heavy bank reliance on the managed liabilities in M3 to fund robust loan growth. From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate near the upper end of the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate appreciably above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately on balance over recent months and was estimated to have grown last year at a rate near the midpoint of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would be sustained at a rate a bit above the economy's estimated growth potential. The increase in consumer spending was projected to moderate somewhat from its pace in the fourth quarter to a rate generally in line with the expected rise in disposable income. Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits. Fiscal policy and the external sector were expected to exert small restraining influences on economic activity over the year ahead. With resource utilization high and rising, consumer price inflation, as measured by the CPI excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the index, was forecast to increase slightly this year in the context of some further pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would include another legislated rise in the federal minimum wage.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the robust performance of the economy in the fourth quarter partly reflected some sources of strength, notably a surge in exports, that were evidently temporary, and they anticipated substantial moderation in the pace of the expansion over the period ahead. The outlook was subject to considerable uncertainty, but as they assessed the numerous factors bearing on prospective developments, the members generally concluded as they had at previous meetings that further growth in aggregate demand at a rate averaging near or a bit above the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation. Many observed, however, that the risks to such an outlook appeared to be tilted to the upside. The strength of the expansion in the fourth quarter, and in fact over 1996 as a whole, had heightened concerns that the economy had considerable forward momentum at a time when it was already operating at a level, especially with regard to labor resources, that could tend to generate rising inflationary pressures. Indeed, in the view of at least some members, growth of aggregate demand in line with increases in potential output posed a risk of rising price inflation because the recent relatively favorable price performance was seen in this view as reflecting at least in part the behavior of special factors that could dissipate over the projection horizon.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for the growth of money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1997. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate associated with these growth expectations were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter of the year. With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1997, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent, with an overall range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent. Nearly all the members anticipated a small decline in the rate of inflation in 1997, as measured by the consumer price index, from that recorded in 1996. Specifically, the projections converged on rates of 2-3/4 to 3 percent and a full range of 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent in 1997. These forecasts took account of expected developments in the food and energy sectors and further technical improvements in the index by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, both of which were expected to trim the reported rate. The projections were based on individual views concerning what would be an appropriate policy over the projection horizon to further progress toward the Committee's goals.  In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members observed that the available data and anecdotal information indicated considerable strength in consumer spending in recent months, and they referred to a number of underlying factors that should help to sustain at least moderate further growth in such spending. The latter included the solid expansion in employment and incomes, the increased financial wealth of many consumers, and the high level of consumer confidence as indicated by recent surveys. However, members also cited some factors that would tend to restrain the growth in consumer spending. Among these factors were the effects of the high level of consumer debt and rising repayment problems on both the willingness of households to borrow and of financial intermediaries to lend, the likely absence of pent-up demands after an extended period of expansion, and the possibility of a setback in the stock market. It was difficult to evaluate how these differing factors would on balance affect consumer spending, but the members concluded that the consumer sector was likely to provide important support for sustained economic expansion.  The growth in business capital spending was expected to moderate somewhat in 1997 in association with slower growth in sales, profits, and cash flows. It also seemed likely after several years of robust investment expenditures that many business firms now had high levels of up-to-date capital stock relative to planned production. Members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms. Members also reported that commercial building activity had improved in many areas. Some noted a tendency to underestimate the strength of overall business investment in recent years, including the stimulus provided by efforts to improve productivity in highly competitive markets.  While indicators of housing activity had been somewhat erratic over the past several months, members sensed a somewhat softer tone on balance in this sector of the economy. This assessment was supported by anecdotal observations in several regions across the country. Against the background of the increase that had occurred earlier in mortgage financing costs and forecasts of some slowing in the growth of jobs and incomes, the housing sector was likely to weaken slightly over the coming year, but some members commented that surprises on the upside of current forecasts, as in 1996, could not be ruled out.  Fiscal policy and foreign trade also were seen as likely to exert some modest restraint on overall economic activity. Federal purchases of goods and services still appeared to be on a declining trend. Although fiscal policy negotiations were likely to be difficult and their outcome was uncertain, members felt that there was some basis for anticipating the enactment of further legislation this year to help bring the federal budget into eventual balance. The large increase in exports in the fourth quarter clearly was associated with temporary developments, and net exports were expected to weaken this year, reflecting both some reversal of recent developments and the earlier appreciation of the dollar. Some members reported that business contacts had already communicated concerns about increased competitive pressures from imports because of the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Members commented that inflation had remained remarkably subdued, but they expressed considerable concern about the risks of rising inflation in the context of high levels of resource use. They referred in particular to statistical indications, supported by anecdotal reports from around the nation, of very tight conditions in labor markets and some upward pressures on wages. Thus far, the rise in compensation had been held down by diminishing increases in worker benefit costs, and productivity gains also appeared to have had a favorable effect on unit labor costs. In addition, the increases in wages themselves had continued to be restrained by apparent worker concerns about job security. To date, there was no evidence that pressures stemming from tight labor markets had been passed through to a measurable extent to higher prices.  While the absence of increasing price inflation was a welcome development, members were concerned that the break with historical patterns might not persist. If labor markets remained under pressure, nominal compensation costs were likely to pick up at some point as one-time savings in worker benefit costs ran out and as workers became less willing to trade off lower wages for increased security; such a development would foster increases in labor costs that ultimately would feed through to higher prices. The members did not anticipate a sudden surge in inflation, but many expressed concern about the possibility of a gradual upcreep in coming quarters that might become more considerable later. They generally expected a small decline in overall price inflation this year, reflecting favorable developments in food and energy and, for the CPI, further technical improvements by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; however, they believed that the risks to their forecasts were in the direction of greater inflation and several noted in particular that projected declines in energy prices might not materialize as soon or to the extent assumed in many forecasts.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored or could support a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance; the members also strongly supported the retention of a bias toward restraint. An unchanged policy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent, with few signs of emerging price pressures, with growth in economic activity seen as likely to moderate appreciably from the unexpectedly strong and unsustainable pace of the fourth quarter, and with considerable uncertainty about future inflationary developments. However, the members emphasized that the extent of the slowdown in economic expansion was unclear and that the persisting, or even greater, tightness of labor markets, coupled with potentially faster growth in worker benefits and diminishing worker insecurity, could put added upward pressure on labor costs and induce some increase in price inflation over time. Even so, most members thought that inflation likely would remain contained for some period ahead and that any strengthening in inflation pressures probably would be gradual, allowing the Committee to respond in a timely manner. Several also commented that a tightening policy action was not generally anticipated in financial markets, and a move at this time could have exaggerated repercussions. A few members emphasized, however, that the recent surge in economic activity had raised the probability that the level of economic output was now above the economy's long-run potential, and without a significant slowing in economic growth, inflationary pressures were more likely to increase over the forecast horizon. While an immediate tightening of policy would help to forestall such a buildup of pressures, the members agreed that current uncertainties about the outlook for both the rate of expansion and inflation warranted a continuing ""wait and see"" policy stance, or at least made such a policy acceptable at this juncture.  In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, the members recognized that an asymmetric directive tilted toward tightening was consistent with their general view that the risks were now more clearly in the direction of an upward trend in inflation. They agreed that the current environment called for careful monitoring of new developments and for prompt action by the Committee to counter any tendency for price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally. Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economic expansion strengthened markedly in the fourth quarter. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in December after sizable gains over October and November. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent in December. Industrial production rose sharply in November and December. Consumer spending posted a large increase in the fourth quarter after a summer lull. Housing activity moderated somewhat over the closing months of the year. Growth in business fixed investment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter after a sharp rise in the third quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed considerably in October and November from its rate in the third quarter. Advances in labor compensation trended up in 1996, but price inflation generally diminished apart from enlarged increases in food and energy prices.  Most market interest rates have changed little or risen slightly since the Committee meeting on December 17, 1996. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has increased substantially over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter and appeared to have continued at a fairly brisk, though diminished, pace in January. From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, M2 is estimated to have grown near the upper end of the Committee's annual range and M3 well above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded moderately on balance over recent months and is estimated to have grown last year near the midpoint of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed after having surged in late 1996 and earlier this year. Consumer spending appeared to be increasing at a considerably slower pace after the spurt in the first quarter, while business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend, and the demand for housing seemed to be well maintained. Growth of labor demand had moderated somewhat from the rapid pace at the beginning of the year, but labor markets remained tight and worker compensation appeared to be accelerating gradually. Despite the upward drift in labor costs, underlying price inflation was still subdued.  Private nonfarm payroll employment rose at a considerably reduced pace over March and April, and the average workweek dropped from an unusually high rate in February and March to a more normal level in April. The services industries recorded further large gains in employment in March and April, but the number of jobs in manufacturing contracted in April and construction employment declined in both March and April. The civilian unemployment rate fell appreciably in April to 4.9 percent, and the labor force participation rate edged down from the record high reached in March.  Industrial production was unchanged in April after having recorded sizable increases in March and other recent months; declines in mining and manufacturing were offset by a large rise in utility output. The drop in manufacturing production reflected a sharp decline in the output of motor vehicles and parts that was largely related to the lagged effects of strike activity in recent months. The output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts rose moderately in April: the production of business equipment posted another solid gain while the output of consumer goods and construction supplies was unchanged. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity fell in April, reflecting the decline in motor vehicle output, but it remained relatively high.  Nominal retail sales were unchanged in March and declined in April after having increased rapidly in earlier months. Weaker sales of motor vehicles contributed to the overall sluggishness of retail activity in March and April, but spending on many other categories of goods, both durable and nondurable, also was down over the two-month period after having previously grown strongly. Expenditures on services advanced further through March (latest available data) even though unseasonably mild weather held down outlays for heating. While retail sales had slowed recently, the latest surveys indicated that consumer sentiment had risen further from an already markedly high level.  Housing activity in March and April was in line with that in other recent months. Single-family housing starts were unchanged in April after declining in March. Starts for the two-month period were only a little below the average for 1996, and sales of new homes remained at a very high level in March (latest data). Multifamily starts rose considerably in April and on average over March and April were a little above the elevated level in the fourth quarter.  Business fixed investment expanded briskly in the first quarter. Outlays for producers' durable equipment rebounded after fourth-quarter weakness, and spending for nonresidential structures posted another substantial advance. Available indicators pointed to further sizable gains in spending on both equipment and structures. Business inventory investment was up considerably in the first quarter after increasing by a relatively small amount in the fourth quarter; however, inventory-sales ratios for most industry and trade groupings remained at very low levels.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on balance over January and February from the temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter of last year and was about the same as the rate in the third quarter. A surge in imports reflected a rebound in the importation of automotive products from the strike-reduced level of the fourth quarter, further expansion in purchases of imported computers, and an upturn in imports of semiconductors after four quarters of declines. By contrast, exports of goods and services rose only slightly in the January-February period; exports of automotive products were up sharply, but sizable increases in exports of chemicals, computers, and semiconductors were largely offset by declines in other non-automotive trade categories. Recent economic information on the foreign G-7 countries, including some preliminary indicators for the second quarter, suggested that the growth of output had strengthened somewhat on average in these countries. Activity in continental Europe, though still weak, was improving, while the economies of Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom remained strong. Economic activity continued to expand rapidly on average in the major developing countries in the first quarter.  Recent data indicated that price inflation remained moderate despite a gradual acceleration of labor costs. Increases in consumer prices were held down in March and April by sizable declines in energy prices and a small net reduction in food prices. Consumer prices for items other than food and energy advanced at a moderate rate over the two months, and over the twelve months ended in April they increased by the same amount as in the previous twelve months. Producer prices fell in both March and April, reflecting large declines in energy prices. Excluding food and energy, producer prices edged lower in April after rising a sizable amount in March. Core producer prices increased considerably less over the twelve months ended in April than over the previous twelve months. At earlier stages of production, producer prices registered declines both in recent months and for the twelve months ended in April. An upward creep in the growth of labor costs was apparent in data on the hourly compensation of private industry workers; although the rise in the first three months of 1997 was smaller than the increase in the fourth quarter, the advance over the twelve months ended in March was larger than that over the previous twelve months. A similar but more pronounced pattern was evident in data on average hourly earnings for production or nonsupervisory workers.  At its meeting on March 25, 1997, the Committee issued a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions; the firming of policy was taken in light of continued rapid growth of aggregate demand in the first quarter and the attendant greater risk of heightened pressures on resources and an upturn in inflation. Although further policy tightening might be needed at some point, the Committee did not believe that developments during the intermeeting period were likely to require an adjustment, and thus the directive did not include a presumption about adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations immediately after the meeting on March 25 were directed toward implementing the slightly firmer reserve conditions desired by the Committee and then maintaining those conditions over the remainder of the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged close to the higher intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Open market operations were complicated during the period by extraordinarily large federal tax payments in April, which substantially increased the volume of open market purchases needed to offset the reserve drains associated with those tax payments.  Market interest rates generally posted small mixed changes over the intermeeting period. Most private short-term rates increased only a little in response to the March policy action, which had been largely anticipated by market participants. Intermediate- and long-term yields rose over the early part of the intermeeting period, responding mostly to incoming data suggesting that growth in aggregate demand and output remained strong; these increases were subsequently more than reversed, however, as later information indicated that economic growth was moderating and price inflation remained subdued and on news of an agreement to balance the federal budget. Major indexes of stock market prices fluctuated substantially over the period but they rose considerably on balance.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting period. The movements of the dollar during the period roughly corresponded to the fluctuations in intermediate- and long-term U.S. interest rates; the dollar advanced strongly in April on growing expectations of a further firming of U.S. monetary policy but more than retraced that gain in May as the likelihood of further tightening waned. The dollar's weakness in May also seemed to reflect growing attention to the prospects for official intervention to restrain the dollar's rise, notably against the Japanese yen and the German mark.  The growth of M2 and M3 remained brisk over March and April. Much of M2's strength during this period resulted from a temporary buildup by households of balances in savings accounts and money market mutual funds to cover unusually large tax payments. The rapid growth of M3 was associated not only with the bulge in M2 but also with stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to fund the expansion of bank credit. For the year through April, both aggregates expanded at rates appreciably above the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. The growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had moderated over recent months as a result of reductions in federal government borrowing.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand in the second half of the year at a rate a little above that of its estimated potential and then would increase at a slower and more sustainable rate in 1998. Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further projected gains in employment and income, was expected to remain fairly brisk over the forecast horizon. Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected to be associated with moderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower over coming quarters, partly in conjunction with the rise in mortgage interest rates that already had occurred but also in response to the smaller increases expected in household income. The staff continued to anticipate that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity. With resource utilization high and labor compensation gradually accelerating, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher.  In the Committee's discussion, the members agreed that the information for recent months pointed on balance to a marked slowing in the expansion of economic activity from a very rapid pace in late 1996 and earlier this year. The extent of the reduced growth in the current quarter and the prospects for subsequent quarters were subject to substantial uncertainty, but the members generally felt that the economy retained considerable underlying strength. In the circumstances and assuming no changes from current financial conditions, the individual members saw likely prospects for expansion over the forecast horizon at a pace close to, or a little above, the estimated growth of the economy's long-run potential. Many noted, however, that high levels of consumer and business confidence and supportive financial conditions among other factors suggested the possibility that growth could turn out to be even faster. With the utilization of productive resources, notably labor, already at particularly high levels in relation to the economy's potential, an outcome no stronger than current forecasts could well have adverse implications for inflation. Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time; such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.  In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to favorable underlying factors in the outlook for consumer spending, These included solid growth in consumer incomes, large increases in financial wealth, and currently high levels of consumer confidence. While more moderate growth in consumer spending for durable goods seemed likely after an extended period of robust expansion, these favorable factors suggested that the risks of a different outcome were tilted in the direction of faster-than-projected expansion. On the negative side, large consumer debts were still viewed as likely to constitute an inhibiting influence on consumer expenditures, and many banking institutions had tightened lending terms and conditions at least for their more marginal consumer borrowers. On balance, growth in consumer expenditures at a somewhat reduced pace approximating that of the expected expansion of disposable incomes appeared to be a reasonable prospect, though one that was subject to considerable uncertainty.  Spending for business fixed investment seemed to have retained a good deal of momentum even after the large increases in such expenditures in recent years. Clearly, businesses regarded such investments as highly profitable, and they appeared to be leading to gains in productivity that in turn were helping to offset rising compensation and to maintain profit margins in highly competitive markets. In the circumstances, it appeared unlikely that growth in capital outlays would moderate appreciably for some time. A number of members also referred to the increasing strength in nonresidential construction, notably that of commercial structures, in several parts of the nation. Some referred in particular to planned or actual construction of new office buildings in various locales; such activity was being stimulated by declining vacancy rates, rising rents, and a ready availability of financing. Likewise, a surge in tourism in a number of areas had resulted in a scarcity of hotel rooms and was spurring hotel construction in some major cities. Anecdotal reports of nonresidential building activity undertaken on a speculative basis had increased, but a building boom reminiscent of the 1980s did not appear to be under way.  Concerning the outlook for housing, members referred to forecasts of a mild downtrend in residential construction associated with the increases that had occurred in mortgage interest rates. To date, however, there were few indications of any weakening. Indeed, housing construction had been relatively robust in the early months of the year, though the strength probably was largely accounted for by unusually favorable weather conditions and may have borrowed from building activity later in the year. On balance, as evidenced by anecdotal reports from some areas, various factors including ongoing growth in employment and incomes, the availability of financing on still generally favorable terms, and the associated affordability of housing for many homeowners seemed likely to provide continued support for this sector of the economy for some period of time.  A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter. In keeping with business practices aimed at achieving or maintaining lean inventory-sales ratios, inventory investment was projected to continue at a relatively subdued pace in coming quarters. A number of members expressed the view, however, that stockbuilding represented an upside risk in the economic outlook, at least in the nearer term. While there were some indications of efforts to pare inventories in recent months, generally optimistic business sentiment and currently trim inventories in most industries might well foster efforts to accumulate stocks at a relatively rapid pace, especially if more-buoyant-than-anticipated sales were to stimulate a precautionary demand for inventories as had occurred in 1994.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, members observed that increases in prices had remained subdued despite the rapid expansion in economic activity in recent quarters and the associated increase in pressures on already highly utilized resources. The appreciation of the dollar undoubtedly had helped to damp domestic inflation this year, and reported increases in consumer prices also had been held down to a marginal extent by an ongoing series of technical adjustments to the CPI. These were only partial explanations, however, and the members found it very difficult to account for the surprisingly benign behavior of inflation in an economy that had been operating at a level approximating full employment--indeed, possibly somewhat above sustainable full employment in labor markets in the view of a number of members, especially taking into consideration the recent further decline in the unemployment rate. On the basis of historical patterns, any overshooting of full employment would be expected to generate rising inflation over time. Although increases in labor compensation had been trending higher, these pressures were muted and had not shown through to prices.  Members focused on the possible role of faster-than-reported increases in productivity as a key explanation for the benign behavior of inflation in current circumstances. Business firms had continued to report robust profit margins in a period when competitive pressures generally prevented them from raising their prices, or raising them sufficiently, to pass on the increases that they were experiencing in worker compensation. Standard statistical measures that pointed to relatively limited increases in productivity seemed inconsistent with strong profits as well as with anecdotal reports of sizable gains associated with widespread business restructuring activities and large additions of high-technology equipment to an increasingly efficient capital stock. The ongoing development and spreading adoption of automated equipment along with the increasing skills and other infrastructure needed to use it effectively appeared to be creating growing efficiencies or synergies that were markedly enhancing productivity and enabling firms to hold the line on prices and maintain high profit margins.  While these were welcome developments, members continued to express concern that, perhaps sooner rather than later, growing pressures on productive resources would be reflected in some upturn in overall inflation. Although most measures of labor compensation had been relatively favorable recently, such measures had been displaying a clear uptrend over a somewhat longer period, and it seemed likely that, if this trend continued, labor cost developments would at some point be reflected more fully in core measures of prices. Members commented that the timing and extent of any upturn in price inflation would depend on growth of overall demand in the economy, but they also believed that expansion of demand in line with their current expectations could induce a somewhat less favorable inflation experience during coming quarters. However, recent developments had underscored the fact that historical experience was not a fully reliable guide to the prospective behavior of prices; accordingly, the inflation outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one of the members indicated that they could support a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, although some also expressed a preference for some tightening at this meeting. Those who endorsed a steady policy at this time agreed that some tightening might well be needed later to contain potentially rising inflation. For now, however, economic growth seemed to be slowing to a more sustainable pace, and the uncertainties surrounding the extent of the slowing and the outlook for inflation pointed to the desirability of a cautious approach to any policy tightening, especially given the persisting absence of a rising inflation trend in current measures of prices. A number of members also observed that real interest rates were not unusually low. Thus, the present stance of monetary policy probably was not very far out of alignment with what likely would prove to be a desirable degree of restraint, thereby lessening any risk of large and persisting imbalances that a delay in implementing further restraint might incur.  Members who preferred some tightening, at least in the near term if not necessarily at this meeting, noted that the Committee needed to weigh the risks of having to implement a small degree of restraint now versus considerably more later if inflation were allowed to build momentum. Monetary policy exerts its effects with a considerable lag, and a small but relatively prompt tightening action would provide some further insurance against an intensification of inflation. Such an outcome could be seen as more likely now, given the increased tightness in labor markets and the possibility that relatively strong growth would put added pressures on resources. Some of these members commented that the risk of a retarding effect on the economy from a small move at this time was quite limited in light of the apparently solid momentum of the economic expansion. Indeed, the strength of investment demand, the ready availability of financing, and possible favorable productivity gains argued that real rates of interest would need to be higher than historical norms to balance aggregate demand and supply. The risk of slightly lower economic growth needed to be compared with what they viewed as the greater risk of losing ground to inflation and thereby inhibiting the Committee's ability to reach its ultimate goal of price stability, a goal that all the members viewed as necessary to achieve maximum sustainable economic growth over time. Given the quiescence of inflation and the uncertainties surrounding its outlook, however, all but one of these members could accept a wait-and-see policy stance for now.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members supported a shift from the symmetric directive that had been adopted in conjunction with the policy tightening action at the March meeting to an asymmetric directive tilted toward tightening. While such a bias did not necessarily imply an intention to tighten policy during the weeks immediately ahead, it was consistent with the members' view that the risks were in the direction of a potential need for some tightening in monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, and that they might be required to make such a decision in the not-too-distant future.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed after surging in late 1996 and earlier this year. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased at a considerably reduced pace over March and April, but the civilian unemployment rate fell appreciably to 4.9 percent in April. Industrial production was flat in April following sizable gains over previous months. Nominal retail sales were unchanged in March and declined in April after a considerable advance in earlier months. Housing activity in March and April was little changed from other recent months. Available indicators point to further sizable gains in business fixed investment. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January-February from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter. Underlying price inflation has remained subdued.  Market interest rates generally have posted small mixed changes since the Committee meeting on March 25, 1997; share prices in equity markets have risen considerably. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 was brisk over March and April, boosted by a buildup in household balances to cover unusually large tax payments. For the year through April, both aggregates expanded at rates appreciably above the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has moderated over recent months, reflecting reductions in federal government borrowing.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.  Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.  Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the strength of investment demand, due possibly to an increase in the trend growth rate of productivity, required somewhat higher real interest rates to prevent inflationary pressures from developing. He was concerned that, with the economy already operating at a high level and labor markets apparently very tight, any increase in such pressures might be costly to reverse and might reduce the credibility of the Committee's longer-run strategy of promoting maximum sustainable growth by fostering price level stability. He also believed that the risk to the economy of a moderate further tightening was small given the apparent momentum of aggregate economic activity.",199703,0,360,1997-03-31,0.35,0.27,0.04,-0.11,0.54,0.63,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1997-03-25

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy had continued to expand at a relatively robust pace in early 1997 after strengthening markedly in the fourth quarter of 1996. Much of the more recent growth reflected further acceleration in consumer spending, but business capital expenditures, housing activity, and an upturn in inventory investment also had contributed to the recent increase in total expenditures. By contrast, available data pointed to a sharp drop in net exports after a surge in the fourth quarter. To meet the strong aggregate demand, employment had recorded another large advance in early 1997 and industrial production had risen somewhat further. The underlying trend in consumer price inflation had remained subdued, but the increase in average hourly earnings had continued to edge higher early this year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in January and February. The gains continued to be led by sizable advances in the services and trade industries. Employment in construction increased considerably over the two months, largely because of unseasonably warm weather across much of the country in February that led to an earlier-than-usual pickup in building activity. Aggregate hours of private production workers, which were also affected by changing weather conditions, were up appreciably on balance over the two months, and the average workweek increased considerably, reaching a new recent high in February. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in February, was unchanged from its average level in the second half of 1996.  Industrial production rose appreciably in February after declining slightly in January. The February advance resulted from a surge in the manufacturing of durable goods that was only partly offset by a plunge in the output of utilities associated with unseasonably mild weather in that month. The utilization of total manufacturing capacity was unchanged on balance over the two months at a level slightly above its long-term average.  Consumer spending strengthened considerably further in early 1997 after registering a sizable increase over the fourth quarter. Nominal retail sales rose sharply in January and February. The gains over the two months were concentrated in sales of durable goods, including motor vehicles and building materials. Spending on services rose strongly in January (latest data) but may have moderated in February when milder-than-normal weather held down heating costs. Recent surveys indicated that consumer confidence had risen to the highest levels in many years.  Housing construction rose sharply in February after two months of relatively depressed activity. On balance, various indicators of housing activity had been mixed over the past several months and did not suggest any clear trend in spending for new housing.  Recent trends in orders and shipments pointed to a sizable further rise in outlays for producers' durable equipment in early 1997, largely reflecting continued rapid growth in purchases of computers and some further increase in spending for communications equipment. Expenditures for other types of equipment remained little changed. In the nonresidential construction sector, trends in contracts suggested some further spending gains in most market segments after strong advances in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing and trade inventories rose somewhat in January, roughly offsetting small declines over the previous two months. With sales and shipments rising rapidly in January, inventory-sales ratios for a wide range of industries dropped further from already low levels.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter. Nearly all the deterioration in the trade balance reflected a sharp rise in imports; that increase was largely the result of a rebound in automotive shipments from Canada, which had been temporarily reduced by a strike. Recent information on economic activity in the G-7 countries suggested continued expansion at a moderate rate on average in early 1997, but rates of expansion had continued to diverge among those economies. Growth in output still appeared to be relatively strong in Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom, while much weaker economic performances were indicated for the major continental European countries. The economies of the major developing countries in Latin America and eastern Asia apparently continued to expand in late 1996.  Data for January and February were consistent with the continuation of a subdued trend in underlying price inflation. Overall consumer price inflation moderated somewhat over the two months from its pace in the fourth quarter; smaller increases in energy prices were an important factor in the slowdown, but prices of consumer items other than food and energy also advanced at a slower rate over the first two months of the year. For the twelve months ending in February, consumer prices excluding food and energy rose somewhat less than they had over the preceding twelve months; a development contributing importantly to the deceleration was a smaller rise in non-oil import prices associated with the appreciation of the dollar. At the producer level, overall prices of finished goods declined somewhat in January and February, reflecting an appreciable drop in the food and energy components. For the twelve months ending in February, the increase in the overall index of finished goods prices was little changed from that over the preceding twelve months, but excluding food and energy prices, which had registered sizable advances in 1996, the rise was considerably smaller over the latest twelve-month period. At early stages of processing, however, some producer prices had moved up in recent months. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers posted small further increases in January and February but were up appreciably more over the twelve months ending in February than over the preceding twelve months.  At its meeting on February 4-5, 1997, the Committee issued a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions, reflecting a consensus among the members that the risks were clearly in the direction of an upward trend in inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be toward some tightening than toward easing. In this regard, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing of the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Over the period since the February meeting, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Federal funds continued to trade mainly at rates close to the 5-1/4 percent level expected with an unchanged policy stance, though the rate did at times fall below that level in conjunction with unanticipated shortfalls in demands for excess reserves. Most other market interest rates rose somewhat over the intermeeting period in apparent response to indications of stronger-than-expected economic activity, perceptions that the Federal Reserve had become more concerned about a possible buildup in inflation pressures, and perhaps disappointment over the prospects for legislation to reduce the federal budget deficit. In these circumstances, expectations built that monetary policy would be tightened. The rise in most market interest rates was accompanied by slight declines in a number of major indexes of stock market prices, although stock prices in some industries posted more pronounced declines.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose further over the intermeeting period. The dollar's appreciation appeared to reflect spreading perceptions of a relatively strong U.S. expansion and associated increases in U.S. interest rates compared to those abroad. The dollar's rise was most pronounced against the continental European currencies.  Growth of M2 moderated somewhat in January and February from a brisk pace in late 1996, while expansion of M3 remained rapid in both months. Data for the first part of March suggested diminished growth of both aggregates. The appreciable further expansion of these broad aggregates thus far this year probably continued to reflect elevated income growth, and the relative strength of M3 was associated to an important extent with heavy bank reliance on large-denomination time deposits to fund robust asset growth. M3 also continued to be boosted by the rapid growth of money market mutual funds. The expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have slowed in the early part of the year in conjunction with reduced borrowing by both federal and state governments, which were drawing down cash balances.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity would slow in coming quarters to a pace somewhat above that of the economy's estimated potential and would moderate a bit further in 1998. Growth in consumer spending was expected to decline appreciably from its recent pace but to remain fairly brisk over the quarters ahead, supported by further projected gains in employment and incomes. Expansion in business spending on equipment and structures also was projected to moderate, but to a still relatively high rate, in association with smaller increases in sales and profits. Housing construction was forecast to drift lower over coming quarters, partly reflecting the rise that already had occurred in mortgage interest rates. The staff continued to anticipate that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert mildly restraining effects on economic activity over the year ahead. With resource utilization high and labor compensation rising, core consumer price inflation was forecast to increase slightly over the year ahead.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997. Some observed that it was difficult to detect signs of weakness or imbalances in domestic sectors of the economy. While the members believed that some slowing in the expansion was inevitable, they felt that substantial uncertainty surrounded the timing and extent of such slowing in the quarters ahead. Continued growth near, or even somewhat below, the recent pace would raise resource utilization rates further from their already high levels. Although labor markets already were tight, inflation had remained relatively subdued, and there were no signs in price data that it was picking up. However, the risks of a rise in inflation down the road had increased appreciably as a result of the strength of aggregate demand and the increase in pressures on resources that likely would accompany it absent a firming in financial conditions.  In their discussion of the outlook for spending in key sectors of the economy, members emphasized the strength of consumer spending in recent months. They noted that anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country and surveys indicating very high levels of consumer confidence tended to confirm statistical evidence of an ebullient consumer sector. While the recent surge in consumer demand probably was supported mainly by rapid growth in employment and labor income, it seemed possible that consumers also were responding increasingly to the run-up in household net worth stemming from the earlier buoyant performance of the stock market. The effects of rising financial wealth on consumer spending were difficult to isolate, and they were undoubtedly restrained by efforts to accumulate savings for future expenditures such as college expenses and retirement. Moreover, the constraints on spending imposed by the high debt burdens of many households tended to exert at least a partly offsetting influence on overall consumer spending. On balance, however, the members believed that the consumer sector was likely to provide major ongoing support to the expansion, though the increases in consumer spending probably would diminish in the context of more restrained growth in jobs and incomes. A number of members expressed the view, however, that the risks to such a forecast were in the direction of more robust consumer spending.  Business fixed investment, which had remained on a steep uptrend for an extended period, also was expected to provide continuing though moderating stimulus to the overall economic expansion. Growth in expenditures for business equipment was forecast to decline from the extraordinary pace of recent years, despite continuing brisk demand for computers and communications equipment. With regard to the outlook for nonresidential building activity, anecdotal reports from several regions pointed to a further pickup in commercial construction associated with declining vacancy rates, rising property values and rents, and readily available financing. Indeed, reports from a few areas indicated the emergence of speculative building activity. On the other hand, in some regions, signs of slowing nonresidential construction were reported.  Housing construction activity had fluctuated in recent months, largely in response to changing weather conditions, but such construction appeared to be little changed on balance. Recent anecdotal reports pointed to improving housing markets in several regions and to some easing in a few. Looking ahead, the members generally anticipated that housing activity would be maintained at a relatively high level, perhaps slightly below that prevailing on average in recent quarters, barring unanticipated developments in the broader economy or in financial markets. While the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was a somewhat inhibiting influence on the prospects for housing, favorable factors noted during the meeting included the ongoing effects of the large gains in stock market wealth, sizable increases in employment and incomes, and a still relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.  The persisting efforts by business firms to economize on their inventories had reduced the latter to quite low levels in relation to sales. In the circumstances, current inventory levels were viewed as an upside risk to the expansion that could be triggered by unexpected strength in final demand. Absent an upside surprise in demand, inventories might be expected to remain a slightly positive factor in the economic outlook; and if growth in final demand were to moderate more than anticipated, the currently lean inventories could be viewed as minimizing the risks of accumulating weakness in the near term.  The outlook for fiscal policy remained one of modest restraint; on the basis of existing legislation, reductions were anticipated in constant-dollar purchases of goods and services by the federal government in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. A key element in the potential impact of fiscal policy was the uncertain outcome of the current effort to eliminate the federal deficit over time. Although success in that effort probably would have little effect on the government's budget position over the next few years, it likely would have some beneficial repercussions on business and consumer confidence and possibly also on financial markets. Financial markets would be especially positively affected by an agreement to reduce significantly the growth of entitlements, which would damp government spending and deficits over the longer run.  The unwinding in the early months of 1997 of special factors that had boosted net exports in the fourth quarter of 1996 was offsetting some of the effects on production of the persisting strength in domestic demand. Beyond the near term, the appreciated value of the dollar was expected to hold down net exports, restraining overall demand and growth. Some members observed in this regard that the deterioration in net exports might be substantial. While such an outcome would help to moderate inflationary pressures on domestic resources in coming quarters, it also would exacerbate the longer-term problem of very large foreign trade and current account deficits.  In their review of developments bearing on the outlook for inflation, members commented that the risks now seemed to be tilted more clearly toward higher inflation. They acknowledged that it was difficult to find indications of rising inflation in broad measures of consumer or GDP-related prices; indeed, such measures still could be viewed as consistent with a slightly declining trend in price inflation. Even so, prospects for a substantial period of economic expansion at a rate that exceeded the estimated growth of potential had generated increasing concerns of rising inflationary pressures in an economy that already was operating at high levels of resource utilization. Members observed in this regard that while there was little evidence of growing demand pressures on capital resources, the tightness in labor markets appeared to be intensifying. Indications of such a development included not only widespread anecdotal reports but a variety of data such as initial claims, insured unemployment, and help-wanted advertising. The rise in labor force participation to a high percentage of the working age population had helped to keep the unemployment rate from falling, but the unexpected increase in participation was itself suggesting tight conditions that were inducing marginal workers into the job market.  The data on worker compensation were somewhat mixed, but they suggested some acceleration on balance. Members noted that the damping effects of some temporary factors on labor costs could well begin to wane soon, if they had not already begun to do so. These included the possibility that job security concerns might be diminishing after an extended period of rapid job growth and low unemployment. The downward trend in medical cost increases might be in the process of shifting to a flat, if not a rising, gradient according to informed observers. Moreover, as the rise in labor force participation depleted the pool of available workers, less productive workers would tend to be hired, with adverse effects on productivity and costs. The members recognized that even though aggregate demand pressures seemed to be pressing increasingly on available producer resources, it was not possible to forecast with confidence when the period of favorable price behavior would end. Even so, it was clear that inflationary developments in the economy had become a matter of more urgent concern for monetary policy.  In light of this concern, in the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members supported or could accept a proposal to adjust policy toward a slightly less accommodative stance and to move to symmetry in the directive. They noted that continued relatively rapid growth of economic activity in the first quarter suggested greater persisting strength in demand than they had anticipated. With resource use already at high levels, further rapid growth risked greater pressures on resources and rising inflation. Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing. In this situation, they saw a clear need for a preemptive policy action that would head off any pickup of inflation, and it was noted that a shift to a tighter policy stance would seem to pose little risk to the expansion. Indeed, by countering any tendency for inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally, such action would help head off a more abrupt economic slowing, or even a downturn, and thereby would help sustain the expansion and preserve the firm labor markets and their associated benefits.  A few members argued that a more substantial tightening was needed at this juncture to provide a better calibrated response to the persisting strength of the economy and the related risk of intensifying inflationary pressures. In their view, a more vigorous action would lessen the need for tightening in the future and also would foster a financial setting that would be more conducive to sustained expansion. Other members acknowledged that a smaller policy move would have less effect in curbing inflationary pressures, but they felt that a cautious approach to policy was desirable at a time when the outlook for economic activity and inflation remained subject to substantial uncertainties. Some noted that a shift in policy direction, as the Committee was about to undertake, often can have exaggerated effects in financial markets, making it difficult to judge how much additional restraint, if any, might be needed.  In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, a majority of the members favored a symmetric directive. While additional policy tightening might be needed at some point, it did not appear very likely that developments during the intermeeting period would require a further policy move. Some added that inflation remained quiescent and the near-term onset of an appreciable slowing of the expansion to a rate more in line with the economy's potential could not be ruled out. Accordingly, they felt that the directive should not establish a presumption about further near-term policy tightening. Other members believed that growth of the economy was not likely to slow enough to alleviate excess demands for resources and that additional tightening would be needed sooner rather than later to moderate inflationary pressures and prolong the expansion. In their view, the outlook called for vigilance and the maintenance of an asymmetric directive with a bias toward tightening, but they could accept a symmetric directive with careful monitoring of new developments for any signs of the need for prompt action.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they supported or could accept a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that relatively strong economic growth has continued in the first quarter. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in February, was unchanged from its level in the second half of 1996. Industrial production rose moderately on balance in January and February. Nominal retail sales increased sharply further over January and February after a considerable advance in the fourth quarter. Housing activity strengthened markedly over January and February, though much of the rise probably related to unusually favorable weather. Recent data on orders and contracts point to a further sizable gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter. Underlying price inflation has remained subdued.  Most market interest rates have risen somewhat since the Committee meeting on February 4-5, 1997. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased further over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 moderated somewhat in January and February from a brisk pace over the fourth quarter while the expansion of M3 remained relatively robust; data for the first part of March pointed to diminished growth in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded moderately on balance over recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economic expansion slowed substantially in the second quarter after having surged in late 1996 and earlier this year. Consumer spending decelerated considerably, but business spending on durable equipment increased substantially further and housing demand appeared to have been well maintained. Employment growth moderated recently, while industrial production continued to rise appreciably. Price inflation remained subdued despite high rates of resource utilization, notably that of labor.  Private nonfarm payroll employment rose at a reduced pace in May after having registered sizable advances over the first four months of the year. Job growth remained brisk in the services sector despite a further drop in employment at temporary help agencies that might have reflected constraints on the availability of workers for hire. Although employment in construction recovered in May from the weather-depressed level in April, the underlying growth in such jobs seemed to have slowed. Employment in manufacturing changed little over April and May after having increased moderately in the first quarter. The average workweek for production or nonsupervisory workers was unchanged in May but was slightly below the average for the first quarter. The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further to 4.8 percent in May.  Industrial production continued to grow briskly in May. Manufacturing output recorded a substantial gain and mining production rose considerably; however, cooler-than-average weather led to a drop in utility output. Much of the rise in manufacturing reflected a rebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts from strike-depressed levels in April and strength in the output of business equipment, construction supplies, and materials. With output generally keeping pace with the rapid expansion of factory capacity, the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity remained at a relatively high level.  Personal consumption expenditures, in real terms, rose substantially in May after having changed little on balance over the preceding three months. Spending on services remained on a solid uptrend in May, while aggregate purchases of goods turned up after three months of lackluster spending on nondurable goods and motor vehicles. The unusual weather patterns of late winter and early spring apparently had a depressing effect on consumer expenditures, especially for seasonal items; however, the combination of strong job gains, buoyant sentiment, and increased household net worth pointed to a possible resumption of more robust spending by consumers.  Housing activity appeared to have been generally well maintained in recent months. Although housing starts were down somewhat in May from the relatively elevated average rate for the first four months of the year, this slowing might have been, at least in part, the result of unusually mild winter weather that enabled an early start on spring building activity. The latest information on home sales suggested continued firm demand for single-family housing: Sales of existing homes rose in May and were among the highest monthly totals on record, and sales of new homes in April (latest data available) were down only a little from the brisk pace of earlier months in the year.  Available information suggested further sizable gains in business fixed investment. Shipments of nondefense capital goods edged higher in May after posting large increases in earlier months of the year. Shipments of computers had been particularly strong this year in conjunction with rapidly falling prices, but shipments of other categories of capital goods also had been robust on balance. Recent data on orders pointed to further brisk growth in coming months. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to have eased recently, with construction-put-in-place slipping in March and April from the elevated pace of the first two months of the year. However, other information suggested that the downturn might be shortlived: Vacancy rates for office space had been declining, prices for commercial real estate had been edging up, and recent data on contracts suggested that building activity would improve in coming months.  Business inventory investment picked up sharply in April from the slow pace in March but, overall, stocks remained at a low level in relation to sales. In manufacturing, much of the increase in stocks occurred in capital goods industries in which production was expanding briskly. In the wholesale sector, a substantial decline in stocks in April more than offset a sizable increase in March, and the aggregate stock-sales ratio for the sector fell further over the March-April period. Retail inventories rose considerably in April, with notable increases in stocks of apparel and general merchandise. In a departure from the general downtrend of recent months, inventory-sales ratios for most types of retail establishments were up appreciably in April.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in April from a downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. The value of exports in April rose substantially from the first-quarter level, led by increases in exports of machinery and aircraft. The value of imports also rose but by less than that of exports; imports were up in most trade categories except petroleum products. Recent information suggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to grow at a moderate rate in the second quarter. Growth remained robust in Canada and the United Kingdom and was improving in Germany, France, and Italy. Economic activity appeared to have flattened temporarily in Japan following an increase in the consumption tax in April.  Price inflation remained subdued. For a third straight month, consumer prices recorded only a slight increase in May. Favorable developments in food and energy continued to hold down the overall rise and accounted for a much smaller advance in the index of prices of all consumer items over the twelve months ended in May than over the previous twelve months. The decline in core CPI inflation over the same time period was much less, though this measure of inflation also remained relatively restrained. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy fell further in May and were little changed over the year ended that month. At earlier stages of processing, producer prices for intermediate materials other than food and energy changed little over the year ended in May, and producer prices at the crude level advanced only slightly. The tight conditions prevailing in labor markets were associated with a somewhat larger increase in average hourly earnings in the twelve months ended in May than in the year-earlier period.  At its meeting on May 20, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Because the members saw the potential need for some tightening in monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, perhaps in the relatively near term, the directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged close to the intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other market interest rates declined somewhat on balance during the period. Market participants apparently concluded that the likelihood of further policy tightening had decreased substantially in light of incoming data that suggested slowing growth of final demand and continued subdued inflation. Share prices in equity markets rose considerably further.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was up on balance over the intermeeting period; the advance occurred despite a smaller decline on average in long-term interest rates abroad than in the United States. The dollar rose appreciably against the German mark and most other continental European currencies amid growing market concerns that there would be broad participation in the European Monetary Union despite the fact that the major European countries would not be able to comply strictly with the Maastricht fiscal standards and related expectations that the euro would be a weak currency. In contrast, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the British pound; the yen moved up as markets focused more closely on recent and prospective increases in Japan's current account surplus, and the pound strengthened in anticipation of further policy tightening by the Bank of England.  Expansion of M2 and M3 slowed sharply in May in association with a swing in household balances related to large tax payments; growth of M2 rebounded in June, but M3 accelerated by less. For the year through June, M2 increased at a rate near the upper bound of its range for the year. Rapid growth of M3 over the first half of the year, partly in conjunction with robust expansion of bank credit, placed growth of this aggregate somewhat above the upper bound of its range. The rate of increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt had been a little higher in recent months; for the year to date, this aggregate had grown at a rate near the middle of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand at a pace somewhat above that of its estimated potential in the second half of the year but would slow to a rate of increase more in line with that of potential in 1998. Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further projected gains in employment and income, was expected to be relatively brisk for some time. Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue outpacing the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected to occur in the context of moderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower over the forecast period. The staff anticipated that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity. With labor compensation gradually accelerating in the context of high resource utilization, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the continuing exceptional performance of the economy, including widespread indications of strength in business activity and subdued inflation. Following a surge in late 1996 and earlier this year, the rate of expansion had moderated considerably in recent months, and the members generally expected economic activity to settle into a pattern of growth over the next six quarters that would approximate the economy's estimated output potential. A major factor in that outlook was their expectation of some deceleration in demands for consumer durables and business plant and equipment in light of the substantial buildup of such assets that already had taken place in recent years. However, given the underlying strength of the expansion, favorable financial conditions, and the absence of major imbalances in the economy, the risks of a different outcome were judged to be in the direction of somewhat faster growth than currently projected. The outlook for inflation was subject to particular uncertainty. Despite an economy that had been operating for a considerable period at rates of resource utilization that were very close to, and by some estimates somewhat above, sustainable levels, inflation had remained relatively low and indeed had declined on the basis of some broad measures of prices. Such an outcome was very much welcome, but the reasons for it were not completely understood and appeared to include some factors that might exert only temporary restraint on price increases. Consequently, continuing pressures on resources associated with economic growth in line with the members' current forecasts could well be reflected in rising inflation over time.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1997 and 1998. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1997 as a whole had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent and for 1998 were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1997 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 1998. The civilian rate of unemployment associated with these forecasts had a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarters of both years. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, pointed to a sizable moderation this year from the rate in 1996 and a partially offsetting rise in 1998, with prices of food and energy accounting for much of the swing. Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 1997 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 1998.  In their review of the outlook for economic activity in major sectors of the economy, members referred to the generally sluggish pace of retail sales in recent months. It was noted, however, that the slowdown was perhaps in part an adjustment to very strong growth of sales in previous months, and some members commented on anecdotal indications of some pickup in recent weeks. More importantly, underlying trends and fundamentals pointed to prospective growth in consumer expenditures at a pace that was likely to continue to provide key support for further moderate expansion in overall economic activity. In particular, jobs and incomes had continued to post sizable gains; further large increases in stock market prices had raised wealth-to-income ratios sharply; and consumer optimism had risen to new highs. On the other hand, the accumulation of consumer durables that had occurred over the course of the current cyclical advance was likely to exert a retarding influence on the rise in consumer spending. Other somewhat restraining factors included the prospect of some softening in housing demand and related purchases of household goods and the already heavy debt repayment burdens of many consumers. Some members also noted that a possible correction from the currently elevated levels of stock market prices could have adverse effects on consumer sentiment and purchasing power. On balance, growth in personal consumer expenditures was seen as likely to approximate the moderate rate of increase projected in overall domestic demand.  The members viewed the prospects for further growth in business fixed investment as another important supportive factor in the outlook for sustained economic expansion. Current indicators pointed to the continuation of very rapid growth in such spending over the near term, but some moderation was likely over the course of coming quarters in conjunction with the projected slowing in the increase of overall demand and the very large buildup in the stock of capital that already had occurred in recent years. Even so, investment spending was likely to be relatively robust over the projection horizon in the context of continuing incentives to hold down production costs in highly competitive markets and to take advantage of falling prices and wider applications for certain types of new equipment, notably computer-related equipment. The ready availability of both debt and equity finance on favorable terms, an upbeat outlook for sales in many industries, and generally high profit levels were other positive factors. The outlook for nonresidential construction activity also seemed to be relatively favorable. Members referred to declining vacancy rates and rising rents for commercial structures in many parts of the country and noted that construction contracts for new office buildings and hotels recently had turned up on a nationwide basis after a pause earlier this year. In sum, the growth in business fixed investment seemed likely to continue to outpace that of overall demand in coming quarters.  Some restraint on aggregate demand would come from other sectors of the economy--notably government spending, net exports, housing, and perhaps business inventories. None of these factors seemed likely to exert a substantially negative effect, but in total they were expected to help keep the pace of the expansion close to the estimated rate of increase in the economy's potential over coming quarters.  During the course of the Committee's discussion, many of the members commented on the persistence of an impressively benign inflation performance despite widespread indications of very high, and by some measures increasing, levels of capacity use. Indeed, most broad measures of prices pointed to subdued or even declining inflation, and it was difficult to find evidence of rising inflation pressures in ""pipeline"" price data or the wage structure. The members anticipated that inflation as measured by the consumer price index would decline appreciably over 1997 as a result of favorable developments in the food and especially the energy sectors of the economy and declining import prices associated with the previous appreciation of the dollar. These positive influences would wane over time, however, and consumer prices were likely to rise at a somewhat faster pace in 1998.  The members agreed that the risks to their price forecasts were in the direction of higher inflation, given already high levels of capacity use and their expectations of appreciable further economic growth. Nonetheless, the relatively low inflation experienced despite a lengthy period of fully employed resources suggested that the timing of a potential upturn in inflation--indeed whether inflation would in fact pick up--could not be predicted with any degree of confidence on the basis of past historical patterns. The reasons for the persistence of a relatively benign inflation performance in the current expansion were not fully understood. They included some temporary factors such as the effect of the rise in the dollar on import prices and the restraint on health care costs. More fundamentally, they presumably also involved the favorable effects on production costs of widespread business restructurings and the large volume of investment in more productive technology in recent years, the impact of both factors on the job security concerns of workers and their willingness to accept reduced increases in compensation, and the effects of an intense degree of competition among domestic and foreign producers in U.S. markets. With regard to the possibility that more robust productivity increases would be holding down production costs, it was noted that a surge in economic activity, such as had occurred in late 1996 and early 1997, tended to be accompanied by above-trend gains in productivity. A slower pace of economic growth in the second quarter and beyond might provide an opportunity to assess whether productivity increases were on a clear uptrend and could help to explain the favorable behavior of prices over an extended period. In any event, it was too early to reach any firm conclusion on this issue or the broader question of whether or when a rise in inflation might materialize under anticipated economic conditions.  The members also discussed a staff study of the relative performance of various prices indices as measures of inflation. Members noted that most broad measures of inflation moved together over extended periods of time, but they did not always do so over short intervals. Differences in construction, coverage, and other factors meant that none of the individual measures was clearly superior in assessing general inflation trends, and several members commented that all measures needed to be monitored.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored or could support a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, and they strongly supported the retention of a bias toward restraint. An unchanged policy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent and business activity projected to settle into a pattern of moderate growth broadly consistent with the economy's long-run output potential. While the members assessed risks surrounding such a forecast as decidedly tilted to the upside, the slowing of the expansion should keep resource utilization from rising substantially further, and this outlook together with the absence of significant early signs of rising inflationary pressures suggested the desirability of a cautious ""wait and see"" policy stance at this point. In the current uncertain environment, this would afford the Committee an opportunity to gauge the momentum of the expansion and the related degree of pressure on resources and prices. The risks of waiting appeared to be limited, given that the evidence at hand did not point to a step-up in inflation despite low unemployment and that the current stance of monetary policy did not seem to be overly accommodative, at least on the basis of some measures such as the level of real short-term interest rates. In these circumstances, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. Some members commented, however, that in the absence of unanticipated weakness in the economy, some tightening of policy was likely to be needed in the relatively near future, and one expressed the view that a tightening action at this meeting seemed desirable to forestall or limit the risks of intensifying inflationary pressures. However, waiting was an acceptable alternative given the favorable economic news and the persisting uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to prices.  In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they wanted to retain the existing asymmetry toward restraint adopted at the May meeting. An asymmetric directive was consistent with their view that the risks clearly were in the direction of excessive demand pressures in the economy and an associated upward trend in inflation. Such a bias in the directive also would serve the purpose of signaling the Committee's ongoing commitment to curb inflation in the interest of fostering maximum sustainable economic growth and employment. The members agreed that the current environment called for careful monitoring of developments and for prompt action by the Committee if needed to counter rising inflation. Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten on the basis of early signs of potentially intensifying inflation and before higher inflation actually materialized.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate expansion in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economic expansion slowed substantially in the second quarter after surging in late 1996 and earlier this year. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased at a reduced pace in May, but the civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further to 4.8 percent. Industrial production registered another sizable gain in May. Personal consumption expenditures, in real terms, rose substantially in May after having changed little over the preceding three months. Housing activity appears to have been well maintained in recent months. Available indicators point to further sizable gains in business fixed investment. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in April from its downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued.  Market interest rates generally have declined somewhat since the day before the Committee meeting on May 20, 1997; share prices in equity markets have risen considerably further. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was up slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 fluctuated sharply from April to May in association with a swing in household balances related to large tax payments; on balance, both aggregates expanded at a moderate pace over the two months, and available data pointed to further moderate growth in June. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand in recent months and is near the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately. Growth in consumer spending had picked up after having slowed sharply in early spring, business purchases of durable equipment were still on a strong upward trend, and housing demand seemed to have been well maintained. The overall rise in production had been held down recently by supply disruptions in the motor vehicles industry, but employment had continued to expand at a strong pace and the unemployment rate was at a low level. Increases in labor compensation had remained moderate even though labor markets were tight, and price inflation was still subdued.  Private nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in July after a June increase that was below the average for earlier months of the year. The step-up in job growth in July reflected substantially larger job gains in business services, retail trade, and the finance, insurance, and real estate industries. A small decline in manufacturing jobs roughly offset slightly higher employment in construction. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in July, matched its low for the current economic expansion.  Industrial production increased relatively slowly in July after having advanced at a fairly brisk pace over the first half of the year. The July slowdown reflected a temporary drop in motor vehicle assemblies partly associated with work stoppages at a major automotive manufacturer. Outside the motor vehicles sector, the output of business equipment and consumer durable goods rose strongly while the production of consumer nondurables weakened further. Factory capacity increased a little more than production in July, and the utilization of total manufacturing capacity slipped to its lowest level since last autumn.  Retail sales rose briskly in June and July after having changed little over the preceding three months. Sales at automotive dealers rebounded in June and July following substantial weakness in earlier months, and expenditures at nondurable goods stores also strengthened. By contrast, sales at non-automotive durable goods outlets were unchanged over June and July. The pickup in consumer spending occurred against a backdrop of further strong gains in incomes and household net worth. In addition, credit was readily available to most consumers, although lenders continued to tighten terms for marginal borrowers. Total private housing starts were unchanged in July after having rebounded in June from a May decline. Data on home sales in recent months continued to suggest that demand for single-family housing was still relatively buoyant.  Real business fixed investment increased substantially further in the second quarter, reflecting a broad-based surge in spending on producers' durable equipment. Real outlays for office and computing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal computers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend. Spending for communications equipment grew at a slower pace in the second quarter, but recent orders for such equipment pointed to larger increases in the current quarter. Nonresidential construction activity was sluggish in the second quarter. While available information on construction contracts suggested little improvement in building activity in coming months, prices for commercial real estate had risen slightly and vacancy rates had declined.  Nonfarm business inventories increased rapidly in the second quarter, but there were few signs of inventory imbalances. In June, the pace of inventory investment in manufacturing slowed from the rapid average rate for April and May, and the inventory-shipments ratio for the sector was at a very low level. In wholesale trade, stocks rose sharply in June after little net change over the two previous months. Despite the June increase, the stock-sales ratio was at the middle of its relatively narrow range of the past year. At the retail level, the rise in inventories in June retraced only part of the May decline; the inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was near the middle of its range for the last year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was slightly smaller on balance over April and May than the downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. Measured against their first-quarter levels, the value of exported goods and services grew more than the value of imports over the April-May period. The largest increases in exports were in machinery and aircraft and parts, while the biggest gains in imports were in consumer goods, computers, and capital goods other than computers. The available information suggested that in recent months economic activity had expanded further in all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan. Growth continued to be robust in Canada and the United Kingdom and apparently remained moderate in France and Germany. Economic activity in Japan had slowed after a rise in that country's consumption tax in April.  Consumer price inflation picked up slightly in July from the slow pace in each of the previous four months; a small decline in energy prices offset a further increase in food prices. The index for items other than food and energy rose in July at the same low rate recorded for both the first six months of 1997 and the twelve months ended in July. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged down for a seventh consecutive month, reflecting a further drop in food prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged over the twelve months ended in July. At earlier stages of production, producer prices for core intermediate materials rose slightly over the year ended in July and prices of core crude materials increased by a larger amount over the same period. Growth in hourly compensation of private industry workers picked up somewhat in the second quarter, but the rise in compensation over the year ended in June matched the advance over the comparable year-earlier period. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in July, and the rise in such earnings over the twelve months ended in July also was the same as in the year-earlier period.  At its meeting on July 1-2, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Because the Committee continued to see a potential need for some tightening of monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, the directive included a bias toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the average federal funds rate for the period was at the Committee's intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other market interest rates declined further on balance over the period in an atmosphere of greater volatility in financial markets. The net decline in market rates seemed to have reflected a judgment by market participants that the outlook for inflation had improved slightly on balance and that the likelihood of any tightening of monetary policy in coming months had receded a little further. Share prices in equity markets increased on balance over the period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose significantly on balance over the intermeeting period. The appreciation of the dollar was uneven against the currencies of the major foreign industrial countries. The dollar's substantial increase against the German mark and other continental European countries reflected both the continuing favorable developments in the U.S. economy and persisting market concerns that difficulties faced by the major European countries would lead to policies that might detract from strength in the euro. The dollar rose only slightly against the yen. That currency came under downward pressure in reaction to incoming data suggesting a somewhat- greater-than-expected falloff in demand following the recent increase in the consumption tax, but the release of the June current account surplus late in the intermeeting period rekindled market concerns about Japanese external balances and led to some appreciation of the yen.  M2 expanded at a moderate pace over June and July after having fluctuated sharply in April and May as a result of tax-related flows. Data for early August suggested a somewhat faster rate of M2 growth in association with heavier inflows to retail money funds; the latter might have been related to heightened demand for liquidity as a result of recently higher volatility in bond and equity markets. For the year through July, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound of its range. M3 also fluctuated sharply over April and May and grew at a relatively moderate rate in June. M3 surged in July, however, as heavy volumes of large time deposits were issued by U.S. branches of foreign banks to pay down borrowings from their overseas offices and by domestic banks to counter the runoff of government deposit accounts; the latter two sources of funds are not included in M3. For the year through July, M3 expanded at a rate appreciably above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand in recent months at a rate near the middle of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of the economy would be damped in the second half of the year by a slowing of inventory accumulation from the unsustainably brisk pace in the first half of the year. In 1998, the economy would expand at a pace in line with the growth of its estimated potential. Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and projected further gains in employment and income, was expected to be relatively brisk over the forecast horizon. Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected in conjunction with moderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower over the forecast horizon. The staff anticipated that the external sector would exert some mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity. With labor compensation gradually accelerating in the context of higher resource utilization, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher.  The Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments highlighted statistical and anecdotal evidence of a solid economic performance, including indications of a rebound in final demand after a lull during the spring and the persistence of relatively subdued, and by some measures declining, inflation. Growth in consumer spending had slowed sharply and a surge in inventory accumulation had accounted for much of the expansion of economic activity in the second quarter. Looking ahead, the members did not believe that recent developments had altered the prospect that the economy would settle into a pattern of moderate growth approximating its potential. Such a forecast was subject to considerable uncertainty, and several members observed that the risks appeared to be mostly in the direction of stronger growth in demand. With regard to the outlook for inflation, widespread evidence of very tight labor markets was associated with scattered indications that the rise in labor compensation might be accelerating, but overall labor costs had remained relatively damped and price inflation restrained. Gains in productivity and muted increases in nonlabor costs probably also were contributing to holding producer costs under good control. Nonetheless, the members remained concerned about the risks of rising inflation, especially if somewhat-faster-than-projected growth in economic activity were to occur and add to pressures on resources in an economy that already seemed to be operating close to, or perhaps even above, its sustainable potential.  The uncertain prospects for inventory investment were a dominant factor in the outlook for economic activity over the nearer term. The accumulation of inventories had been unusually high in the second quarter according to the available evidence. There was no broad sense of an undesired buildup, but the rate of inventory investment would have to be reined in if an overhang were to be averted. A concern in this regard was that the apparent upturn in final demand, particularly if it proved to be somewhat stronger than currently expected, and related business optimism about sales prospects might well result in a further buildup of inventories at a relatively rapid rate. While such a development was not viewed as the most likely outcome and, indeed, less-than-projected strength in the inventory sector could not be ruled out, relatively rapid inventory accumulation in the context of persisting above-trend growth in final demand would generate additional pressure on resources and heighten the risks of accelerating inflation.  With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors of the economy, members noted that the appreciable rebound in consumer spending followed a weak second quarter, and some moderation in the growth of such spending was likely later this year and in 1998. Even so, favorable prospects for employment and incomes and the large gains that had occurred in financial wealth suggested that consumer expenditures were likely to be well maintained over the projection horizon. The high level of consumer confidence reported by consumer surveys was another supporting factor in this favorable outlook.  In the area of business fixed investment, a strong upward trend in outlays for new equipment was thought likely to persist, notably in the computer-related and the telecommunications industries. Anecdotal reports also pointed to appreciable strength in commercial construction activity, including office structures, hotels, and warehouses in various parts of the country. Indeed, in some areas construction activity was said to be limited only by shortages of qualified labor. Positive factors in the outlook for business investment included the persistence of a high level of profits, an accommodative financial climate, and the rapid obsolescence of high-tech equipment. There were, nonetheless, indications of some moderation in commercial construction activity in a number of areas, including reports of developing overcapacity of retail space in shopping centers. Spending for basic industrial equipment also was likely to soften, given moderating growth in overall final demand in line with current forecasts.  Housing activity continued to display considerable vigor in many parts of the nation as evidenced by available statistics and anecdotal reports. The affordability of housing and the very large increases that had occurred in stock market wealth clearly were supportive factors. Concurrently, however, there were indications of slowing in residential building activity in several areas. On balance, some moderation in housing construction appeared likely over the projection horizon in keeping with longer-term population and other trends affecting such construction.  In the Committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation, members commented that a number of factors could be cited to explain the persistence of relatively subdued inflation this year despite high levels of resource use. Among those factors were the appreciation of the dollar and its effects on prices of imports and competing domestic products, a significant decline in world oil prices, the relatively sluggish performance of many foreign economies that had tended to moderate prices of products traded in world markets, and relatively large grain harvests in the United States that had curbed pressures on food prices. However, the underlying reasons for the favorable price trends were not entirely clear. Labor costs were still rising appreciably less than would have been expected on the basis of past experience under similarly tight labor market conditions. Explanations tended to focus on the concerns about job security felt by many workers, the muted rise in the costs of worker benefits, notably for health care, and the increased use of innovative and highly targeted methods of compensation. With regard to the market pricing of goods, businesses tended to cite highly competitive conditions across the nation that made it very difficult to raise prices and gave impetus to efforts to improve productivity. Indeed, the available evidence suggested that the profits of business concerns generally had continued to increase in the second quarter, implying that productivity had been rising at a pace that exceeded published estimates by a significant margin.  Even though inflation had not accelerated, some signs were beginning to emerge that wages and other labor costs might be experiencing increasing pressure. These included some limited evidence that job security concerns might be diminishing and multiplying anecdotal reports of a less benign outlook for health care costs. Some members commented that the outcome of the recent labor negotiations involving a very large package delivery firm might well be a harbinger of more militant labor negotiating attitudes. Against this background, members expressed concern that a further increase in labor utilization rates could put substantial upward pressures on wages that eventually would work their way through to prices.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. Underlying economic conditions and the outlook for economic activity and inflation had changed little in recent months. The most likely outcome of the current policy stance was growth near potential and some pickup in inflation as the effects of special factors holding it down abated. For the present, monetary policy appeared to be appropriately positioned to foster the Committee's objectives of resisting an intensification of inflationary pressures while supporting a fully employed economy. The level of real short-term interest rates was relatively high by historical standards and provided some assurance that the current stance of policy would not accommodate a significant increase in underlying inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, the members remained concerned about the outlook for inflation. Although some decline in inflation could not be ruled out, persistence of the current degree of tightness in labor markets, consistent with the economy growing at a pace near its potential, could at some point begin to put more pressure on costs and prices, and growth somewhat above potential, which some members saw as a distinct possibility, would be even more likely to produce that result. While there were no current indications that inflation might be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time, the members saw a need for continuing vigilance. As at earlier meetings, a number of them expressed the view that an anticipatory policy move to counter intensifying inflationary pressures likely would be needed at some point.  In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward a rise in inflation. Accordingly, while they did not attach a high probability to the prospect that the incoming information would warrant a tightening move during the intermeeting period, they continued to view the next policy move as more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.  The members reviewed proposals for rewording the operational paragraph of the directive for the purpose of updating and clarifying the description of the Committee's instructions to the Manager of the System Open Market Account and to conform the directive wording with current public announcement practices regarding the Committee's policy decisions. In particular, the directive would in the future include specific reference to the federal funds rate that the Committee judged to be consistent with the stance of monetary policy. The Committee also modified the present sentence relating to the intermeeting bias in the directive to recognize that changes in the stance of policy are now expressed in terms of the federal funds rate. These changes were not intended to alter the substance of the directive or the Committee's operating procedures.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members expressed their support of a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. All the members also agreed on the desirability of retaining a bias in the directive toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate expansion in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. In labor markets, hiring remained robust at midyear, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in July, matched its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production increased relatively slowly in July, owing in part to a temporary drop in motor vehicle assemblies. Retail sales rose briskly in June and July after having changed little over the preceding three months. Housing starts rebounded in June and July after having weakened in May. Business fixed investment increased substantially further in the second quarter and available indicators point to further sizable gains in the current quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly on balance over April and May from its downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued and increases in labor compensation have been moderate.  Market interest rates generally have declined somewhat further since the start of the Committee meeting on July 1-2, 1997. Share prices in equity markets have increased on balance. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose significantly on balance over the intermeeting period.  After fluctuating sharply from April to May, growth of M2 was at a moderate pace over June and July and that of M3 picked up to a relatively rapid rate. For the year through July, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate appreciably above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand in recent months at a rate near the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded briskly further in the third quarter. The expansion was paced by robust growth in consumer spending and substantial further increases in business investment expenditures. Housing demand seemed to have been well maintained over the summer. Employment and production had risen considerably further since midyear. Despite widespread indications of tight labor markets, increases in labor compensation had been moderate in recent months, and price inflation had remained subdued.  Private nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially over July and August despite the retarding effects of a work stoppage at a major package shipping firm. Aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers were considerably above their second-quarter average over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent in August, was marginally above its low for the current economic expansion.  Industrial production increased considerably in July and August, extending a relatively brisk advance over the first half of the year. The output of business equipment rose strongly over the two months, with sizable gains in all major categories, and the output of consumer nondurables turned up after having displayed some weakness in earlier months of the year. The production of consumer durables also increased on balance over the two months. After rising somewhat in other recent months, the utilization of total manufacturing capacity was up appreciably in August, reaching its highest level since the spring of 1995.  Retail sales were up substantially over the summer after having edged lower during the spring. The upturn in recent months included a rebound in sales at automotive dealers following some weakness in earlier months. Sales at non-auto durable and at nondurable goods stores also strengthened after having declined on balance during the second quarter. The pickup in consumer spending occurred against a backdrop of further strong gains in incomes and household net worth that, according to recent surveys, had fostered high levels of consumer confidence. In addition, credit continued to be readily available to most consumers. Total private housing starts and building permits declined in August to levels somewhat below their averages in earlier months of the year, but data on overall home sales and builder ratings of new home sales continued to suggest that demand for single-family housing was still relatively buoyant.  Real business fixed investment had remained on a steep uptrend since midyear, with exceptional ongoing demand for computers and communications equipment and relatively robust demand in other categories of business equipment as well. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to have rebounded somewhat in late spring and early summer after having declined moderately earlier in the year. While new construction contracts displayed little trend, favorable conditions for nonresidential construction were suggested by low vacancy rates, rising prices for commercial real estate, and a widespread availability of financing.  The accumulation of nonfarm business inventories slowed substantially in July (latest data) from its average pace in the second quarter. Inventory investment in manufacturing was only a bit below its pace in the second quarter, but the inventory-shipments ratio for the sector remained at a very low level. In wholesale trade, stocks fell after a sharp buildup in June, and the stock-sales ratio for this sector was at the middle of its relatively low range for the past year. At the retail level, a rise in inventories in July about matched that in June and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was near the middle of its range for the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports. The lower exports of goods and services were associated with decreases in most trade categories and left total exports slightly below their relatively high level of the second quarter. The July increase in imports also was spread among nearly all trade categories and brought total imports of goods and services to a level somewhat above the average for the second quarter. The available information suggested that economic activity expanded further in recent months in all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan. Growth remained relatively robust in Canada and the United Kingdom, and activity apparently picked up in France and Germany after having been sluggish early in the year. Economic activity in Japan declined appreciably in the second quarter, and more recent information provided little clear evidence of subsequent strength.  Price inflation has remained subdued. Consumer price inflation picked up slightly in July and August from a slow rate of increase in each of the previous four months; reduced but still appreciable increases in food prices contributed to the larger advance in both months and a sizable rise in energy prices held up the consumer price index in August. At the producer level, the price index for finished goods rose moderately in August after having fallen for seven consecutive months; the August rise largely reflected a jump in energy prices. Over the twelve months ended in August, consumer prices were up considerably less than in the previous twelve months, while producer prices of finished goods were down slightly after having increased moderately in the previous twelve months. The behavior of these broad measures of inflation excluding the effects of food and energy prices also was favorable over the year ended in August, albeit slightly less so. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers picked up in August from a much reduced pace in July; the rise in such earnings over the twelve months ended in July was slightly above that in the previous twelve months.  At its meeting on August 19, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging about 5-1/2 percent. The directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a somewhat higher federal funds rate to reflect a consensus among the members that the economic risks remained biased toward higher inflation. Although the members did not see a high probability that likely developments would warrant a tightening of policy during the intermeeting interval, they continued to anticipate that the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward some easing. The reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing in the growth of M2 and M3 to more moderate rates over coming months.  Open market operations were directed throughout the inter-meeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged just slightly above the Committee's intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other interest rates in short-term markets were little changed over the period. Rates on longer-term obligations were down somewhat on balance, apparently reflecting a reassessment of the outlook for inflation by some market participants in the light of unexpectedly low inflation and other statistics released during the latter part of the period. The downward movement in long-term interest rates resulted in some further flattening of the slope of the yield curve and appeared consistent with an interpretation that market participants saw little likelihood of any tightening of monetary policy in coming months. Share prices in equity markets continued to display considerable volatility but increased appreciably further on balance over the intermeeting interval.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar experienced mixed changes in relation to major foreign currencies, largely reflecting diverging economic developments abroad. On balance, the dollar's trade-weighted value in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar was down considerably against the mark as data suggesting a pickup in German economic activity and inflation led to market speculation concerning a possible increase in short-term German interest rates. The dollar also registered sizable declines over the period against a number of other European currencies. On the other hand, the dollar rose appreciably in relation to the Japanese yen, which came under selling pressure against the background of continuing sluggish economic conditions in Japan, persistent problems in its financial system, and concerns about the potential effect on Japan of the recent depreciations of Southeast Asian currencies. The dollar also strengthened somewhat in terms of the British pound, in part as a result of some indications that economic activity in the United Kingdom was not as strong as expected and the sizable declines that had occurred recently in that nation's long-term interest rates.  M2 expanded at a rapid pace in August and continued to grow at a still robust though diminished rate in September according to the limited data available for that month. The strength of M2 and also that of M3 was related at least in part to changes in the allocation of financial assets and liabilities rather than to the growth in spending; in particular, the volatility in the stock market evidently fostered a redirection of funds to M2 assets, among others, and included heavy inflows to the money market funds component of M2. For the year through August, M2 rose at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of the Committee's range. M3 grew at an exceptionally rapid rate over the summer months, with only few signs of moderation in September according to the partial data available for that month. Apart from the strength in its M2 components, the increase in this aggregate reflected bank substitution of large time deposits for foreign borrowings to finance credit growth and also reflected substantial inflows to institution-only money funds. For the year through August, M3 expanded at a rate well above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to increase at a relatively moderate rate in recent months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand at a pace significantly above that anticipated earlier for the second half of the year and the early part of 1998, but economic growth was likely to moderate appreciably to a more sustainable rate later. In the near term, business fixed investment appeared to be providing surprisingly strong impetus to income growth, and rising levels of wealth were stimulating robust consumer demand. With sales so strong, the downward adjustment in inventory investment that had been anticipated in the previous staff forecast seemed likely to occur more gradually. The projected strength in aggregate demand appeared likely to intensify pressures on resources and lead to some pickup in inflation. Less accommodative financial market conditions were anticipated to damp these tendencies over time.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the continued remarkable performance of the economy. Strength in consumer spending and further acceleration in capital investment sparked faster-than-expected growth in the third quarter, and relatively brisk economic expansion seemed to be in prospect for a period ahead in the context of very positive business and consumer sentiment, strong demands for capital goods, and favorable financial conditions. The rate of expansion might subsequently be expected to slow as stocks of business capital and consumer durable goods built up relative to sales and incomes, inventory investment moderated somewhat, and the recent strength of the dollar began to exert a drag on exports. It was an open question, however, as to whether these influences would be sufficient to slow the growth of demands for goods and services to a more sustainable pace, and many members suggested that the risks to the forecast were on the side of increases in final demands that would press more intensely against the available resources. Despite high levels of resource utilization, inflation and inflationary expectations had remained subdued to date, reflecting to some extent special influences like the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Moreover, sizable gains in productivity combined with moderate increases in wages and salaries seemed to have contributed to keeping unit labor costs and prices under control. However, the growing tightness in labor markets in many parts of the country was being accompanied by some signs of rising pressures on labor compensation, including the use of special bonuses and other innovative compensation initiatives that are not included in the usual statistical measures of labor costs. In the circumstances, members saw a risk of added wage and price inflation if economic activity did not slow to a more sustainable pace consistent at a minimum with no further appreciable increase in labor utilization rates.  With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, members took note of the rebound in consumer expenditures after a sluggish second quarter. Solid gains in employment, incomes, and household net worth were seen as sustaining further robust expansion in consumer spending. In addition, members anticipated that continued further rapid expansion in investment expenditures by business firms for equipment and structures would provide strong underlying support for the economic expansion. High rates of return on investments in equipment, particularly for computers and communications equipment where prices were falling rapidly, coupled with ready financing from both internal cash flows and external sources were inducing firms to undertake large investment programs. Such investments would expand capacity, improve productivity, and lower costs of production. Anecdotal reports suggested a mixed picture in nonresidential real estate markets. In much of the country, commercial and office vacancies were declining from already low levels and lease rates were rising. Shortages of construction workers were said to be holding back construction in some areas, but in other parts of the country there were indications of some moderation in construction activity and of emerging overcapacity in some markets. The ready availability of financing was a supportive factor in the outlook for nonresidential construction.  A gradual decline in housing activity was expected to exert only mild restraint on the increase of economic activity. Solid job and income growth, the high level of household wealth, and the low cash-flow burden of homeownership would continue to provide good support for housing demand. In this regard, recent statistical and anecdotal information indicated that home sales were holding up well across the country, although higher-priced homes appeared to be selling relatively slowly in some areas.  In the Committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation, members discussed the relative absence of price pressures in an environment of increasingly tight labor markets across the country and rising levels of manufacturing capacity utilization. In labor markets, costs were increasing much less than would have been expected on the basis of previous experience under similarly tight conditions. Among the possible explanations for this outcome were persisting concerns about job security; the muted rise in worker benefits, notably health care; and the increasing use by employers of more flexible and innovative means to attract and retain workers that were in high demand. Moreover, it was suggested that, at least in manufacturing, productivity had risen unusually rapidly of late, allowing corporations to hold the line on prices despite increases in labor costs. While the underlying reasons for the favorable inflation trends were not entirely clear, the members noted that, in addition to subdued increases in labor costs, the appreciation of the dollar and the relatively sluggish performance of many foreign industrial economies seemed to be contributing to the better-than-expected inflation performance by holding down prices in world commodity markets and prices of imported goods more generally. These developments also added to competitive pressures on businesses, which together with customer resistance were making it very difficult for firms to raise prices to reflect their higher costs.  The members commented that while few signs of rising price inflation had surfaced, the widespread tautness of labor markets and the emergence of scattered indications of increased pressure on wages and other labor costs were cause for concern. Anecdotal reports suggested that increases in health care costs were likely to turn up, and there were indications that fears about job security might be diminishing and that workers were becoming less reluctant to leave their jobs before finding better ones. In addition, businesses were reporting increasing difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified workers. Growth in labor demand had been outpacing sustainable increases in labor supply; these reports suggested that the risk of an acceleration in labor compensation was rising.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, but several also indicated that economic developments could well require a tightening of policy in the relatively near future. Members observed in this regard that some factors that had contributed to a currently subdued rate of inflation, notably the appreciation of the dollar, damped wage demands, and relatively limited increases in the cost of health benefits, were not likely to continue to exert the same restraining influence. Moreover, final demands had been unexpectedly strong, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor expanding at an unsustainable pace for some time, and it was unclear whether without policy action overall demands would moderate sufficiently to avoid increasing pressures on resources. In the circumstances, the risks to the economy appeared to be strongly tilted toward rising inflation whose emergence would in turn threaten the sustainability of the expansion. Several members emphasized in this regard that a tightening move could be most effective if it were implemented preemptively, before inflation had time to gather upward momentum and become embedded in financial asset prices and in business and consumer decisionmaking.  There were, nonetheless, a number of reasons for delaying a tightening of policy. The behavior of inflation had been unexpectedly benign for an extended period of time for reasons that were not fully understood. Forecasts of an upturn in inflation were therefore subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the expansion of economic activity could still slow to a noninflationary pace. Members also commented that a policy tightening was not anticipated at this time and such an action might therefore have unintended adverse effects on financial markets. Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive. Several noted, however, that credit from a wide variety of lenders appeared to be amply available in financial markets on favorable terms, perhaps overly so in present circumstances, and some also noted that the strength in the broad measures of money in recent months suggested that policy was not restraining liquidity or financial conditions more generally. In the course of the Committee's discussion of these diverging considerations, a consensus emerged for maintaining a steady policy course at this time, but members also expressed the need for a heightened degree of vigilance as they continued to assess ongoing developments for signs that inflation might intensify in the future.  In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they wanted to retain in the operating paragraph of the directive the existing asymmetry toward restraint that was initially adopted at the May meeting. Such a directive was consistent with their view that the risks continued to be biased toward rising inflation and indeed with the view of most members that those risks might have increased. Accordingly, while the probability that the incoming information would warrant a tightening move during the intermeeting period might not be high, the members continued to view the next policy move as more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. All the members also agreed on the desirability of retaining a bias in the directive toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth of economic activity remains brisk. In labor markets, hiring continued robust over the summer months and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent in August, remained near its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production increased considerably further in July and August. Retail sales have risen sharply over recent months after a pause during the spring. Housing starts declined in July and August, but home sales have been strong. Business fixed investment has increased substantially further since mid-year and available indicators point to further sizable gains in coming months. After narrowing somewhat in the second quarter, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July. Inventory investment in July was well below the average pace in prior months of 1997. Price inflation has remained subdued and increases in labor compensation have been moderate in recent months.  Most market interest rates are about unchanged on balance since the day before the Committee meeting on August 19, 1997. Share prices in equity markets have increased considerably over the period, with some stock price indexes reaching new highs. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 appears to have moderated somewhat in September from a very rapid pace in August, while expansion of M3 remained very strong in both months. For the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand in recent months at a pace near the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months. The further advance reflected a surge in business fixed investment and consumer spending, while housing demand remained at a high level. Significant slowing in exports and inventory investment provided only a partial offset to the strength. Accordingly, production and employment recorded further large gains. Price inflation remained subdued despite tight labor markets and a pickup in the pace of labor compensation.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October. Manufacturing payrolls recorded their largest rise in the current economic expansion, and aggregate weekly hours worked increased significantly; most of the gain in payrolls occurred at durable goods establishments. Hiring remained robust in the service- producing sector, led by sizable increases at computer services and engineering and management services firms. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in October, its low for the current expansion.  Industrial production registered a large advance in the third quarter and apparently remained strong in October. A third-quarter surge in the manufacture of durable goods, notably of motor vehicles, aircraft, and information-processing equipment, more than offset weak expansion in the output of nondurable goods and a decline in mining activity. Although the step-up in manufacturing production boosted further the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity, the latter was somewhat below its most recent peak in January 1995.  Retail sales posted a sharp rise in the third quarter, though growth in sales of both durable and nondurable goods moderated during the quarter. Consumer spending on services also continued to increase at a relatively brisk pace. Growth in such spending was underpinned by continuing substantial gains in incomes, the cumulative increase in household net worth over the past several years, and the ready availability of credit to most consumers. Housing demand remained strong in the third quarter in association with moderate interest rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions. Sales of both new and existing homes increased a bit, and housing starts were little changed in the third quarter from the high level recorded during the first half of the year.  Business fixed investment increased at an unusually rapid rate in the third quarter. The rise in outlays was spread across all categories of producers' durable equipment, but the largest gains were in office, computing, and communications equipment. Available data on new orders pointed to further broad-based and robust expansion in equipment spending in coming months. Nonresidential construction grew at a moderate pace in the latest quarter despite a decline in September. Available information suggested that construction would trend upward at a modest rate in coming months.  Business inventory investment appeared to have moderated substantially in the third quarter from the rapid rate of the previous quarter, and on balance stocks were at relatively low levels in relation to sales. In manufacturing, stocks rose somewhat further in September, but the inventory-to-shipments ratio for the sector declined to the low end of its range for the past twelve months. Wholesale inventories posted another sizable advance in September; the inventory-sales ratio for this sector was just above the high end of its range for the past year. Retail stocks fell in August (latest available data), more than reversing their July increase. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was at the low end of its range for the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on balance over July and August from its rate in the second quarter. Exports of goods and services changed little on net in the July-August period but imports rose considerably; the largest increases in imports were for aircraft and automotive products, but sizable gains also were recorded for computers, semiconductors, and industrial supplies. Available indicators of economic activity in the third quarter pointed to robust expansion in all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where activity rebounded only moderately from a sharp second-quarter decline. Although timely data were sparse, the economies of many Asian countries probably were weakening as their exchange rates came under pressure, problems in their financial sectors were revealed, and their monetary and fiscal policies moved toward restraint.  Consumer price inflation remained subdued in September. The increase in both overall consumer prices and the prices of consumer items other than food and energy was modest. For the twelve months ended in September, prices of consumer items other than food and energy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year- earlier period. At the producer level, the September rise in prices was the largest monthly increment since January 1991; nonetheless, the overall index was unchanged over the past twelve months after a sizable rise over the previous twelve-month period. The core index also decelerated on a year-over-year basis. The rate of increase in the hourly compensation of private industry workers was unchanged in the third quarter, but the advance over the past four quarters was somewhat larger than that for the previous four. Growth in average hourly earnings picked up in September and October, perhaps partly reflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage.  At its meeting on September 30, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging around 5-1/2 percent. The Committee retained a tilt in the directive toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the inter- meeting period, reflecting its view that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising inflation. Reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed throughout the inter- meeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the Committee's intended level of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal funds rate, and the rate averaged close to that level over the period. Other financial markets became quite volatile from time to time. Share prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally turbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, also were volatile, and very large declines were recorded in some of those markets. Against this background, U.S. short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes over the period since the September 30 meeting, while Treasury bond yields declined somewhat on balance. Unexpectedly strong incoming data on U.S. producer prices, employment, and wages tended to exert upward pressures on bond yields on some days, but these were more than offset by investor desires for safety and quality, the continuing moderation in consumer inflation, and the perception engendered by international financial developments that inflation pressures were likely to remain subdued.  The dollar also was affected by the spreading financial turmoil in developing countries, appreciating significantly over the intermeeting period against the currencies of a number of Asian and Latin American countries. Much of the increase was counterbalanced, however, by a sizable decline in the dollar's trade-weighted value in terms of the currencies of the other G-10 countries. The dollar's decline against the German mark and other European currencies partly reflected diminished market expectations of potential tightening in the United States and a snugging of monetary conditions by the Bundesbank and other continental European central banks. Further progress in resolving uncertainties surrounding the European Monetary Union also may have contributed to the rise in European currencies. The dollar appreciated slightly on balance against the Japanese yen.  Growth of M2 and M3 apparently moderated further in October, though the expansion of these aggregates remained brisk. A sharp slowing of inflows to money market mutual funds accounted for much of the deceleration of M2, and an easing in the pace of issuance of large time deposits, evidently reflecting a smaller rise in bank credit, also contributed to a modest reduction in M3 growth. For the year through October, M2 expanded at a rate that was at the upper bound of the Committee's range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt increased in recent months at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand for a time at a pace considerably above its potential, but growth was expected to moderate to a more sustainable rate later. Further rapid increases in business investment would provide strong impetus to income growth in the near term, and the rise in household wealth so far in 1997 would stimulate robust consumer demand going forward. The projected strength of domestic demand would be offset to some extent by a considerable weakening in the growth of exports in response to the lagged effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar and sharp anticipated reductions in the economic growth of Asian and other developing countries.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members focused on widespread indications of a continued solid advance in economic activity, spurred by strength in all major sectors of the domestic economy, and the persistence of subdued increases in prices. The current momentum of the expansion, together with broadly supportive financial conditions and favorable business and consumer sentiment, suggested that economic growth was likely to be well maintained, especially over the nearer term. As a consequence, the members agreed that there remained a clear risk of additional pressures on already tight resources and ultimately on prices that could well need to be curbed by tighter monetary policy. But the members also focused on two important influences that were injecting new uncertainties into this outlook. Turmoil in Asian financial markets and economies would tend to damp output and prices in the United States. To date, it appeared that the effects on the U.S. economy would be quite limited, but the ultimate extent of the adjustment in Asia was unknown, as was its spillover to global financial markets and to the economies of nations that were important U.S. trading partners. The second influence was the apparently sharp increase in productivity in the second and third quarters. This was an encouraging development, although it was too early to judge the persistence of the uptrend in productivity growth and the extent to which it might reduce the additional price pressures that would be generated in the event of an extended period of further robust economic expansion.  Strength in consumer spending had provided an important underpinning for robust economic expansion, and substantial growth was likely to persist, sustained by increases in employment and incomes, high levels of confidence, and the cumulative effects of very large gains in stock market wealth over the past several years. The outlook for capital spending also remained quite favorable because the factors that were contributing to the ongoing surge in such spending--its potential for lowering production costs in highly competitive markets and the ready availability of finance on attractive terms--were likely to persist. While private domestic demand most likely would continue to display considerable strength, both consumption and investment were somewhat vulnerable to developments in financial markets, perhaps arising from further difficulties in Asia. Increased uncertainty about asset values could engender greater caution on spending, and of course a substantial decline in equity values would reduce household wealth and raise the cost of equity capital. Some members also commented that additional appreciation of the dollar, perhaps in association with possible further turbulence in Asia and weakness in foreign economies, would have adverse implications for net exports, which already were seen as a somewhat negative factor in the economic outlook. At the same time, of course, a stronger dollar would have a positive effect on domestic inflation over the projection horizon.  In the course of their discussion, the members gave considerable emphasis to recent developments in labor markets. Statistical indicators of rising levels of employment, low and falling rates of unemployment, and a diminishing supply of new workers were reinforced by anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets throughout the nation. The demand for many types of workers exceeded the supply in many regions, and a number of members reported that growth of economic activity in various parts of the country was being held back by the scarcity of labor. While labor compensation had accelerated, the pickup was moderate in light of the taut conditions in labor markets and some of it reflected the legislated rise in the minimum wage. Nonetheless, members cited numerous examples of efforts to attract or retain workers in especially scarce supply through a variety of bonus payments and other incentives that were not included in standard measures of labor compensation.  The effects on costs and prices of somewhat faster increases in compensation evidently were being muted by what appeared to have been a sharp advance in productivity growth in the last two quarters. The acceleration in productivity seemed to be related in part to the surge in capital spending, which had been stimulated by the ability of new equipment to enhance efficiency and hold down costs, suggesting that productivity might be on a higher trend for a time. But it also could be attributed to some extent to the strengthening in economic output; such strengthening often is associated with a pickup in productivity as producers react initially to the upturn in demand by stretching available labor further. If the pace of the economic expansion were to moderate in line with current expectations, the growth in productivity could also be expected to slow, but to an uncertain extent.  The trend in productivity gains was a key factor in the outlook for unit costs and ultimately for price inflation. As had been true for an extended period, inflation had remained relatively subdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar economic conditions. The reasons for the relative quiescence of inflation were not fully understood, but they undoubtedly included a number of special factors beyond higher productivity such as a lagged response to earlier appreciation of the dollar and unusually damped increases in the cost of health benefits. As they had at previous meetings, members suggested that these favorable influences were likely to erode over the year ahead. A number of members again cited reports of increases in health insurance premiums next year and subsequently. More fundamentally, it was difficult to predict whether anticipated increases in labor compensation would be fully offset by productivity gains in coming quarters and whether, in turn, competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to compensate for any increases in their costs. On balance, the members felt that the risks remained in the direction of rising price inflation though the extent and timing of that outcome were subject to considerable debate.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one member endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, and all agreed that the risks remained tilted toward rising inflation. While developments in Southeast Asia were not expected to have much effect on the U.S. economy, global financial markets had not yet settled down and further adverse developments could have greater-than-anticipated spillover effects on the ongoing expansion. In this environment, with markets still skittish, a tightening of U.S. monetary policy risked an oversized reaction. Some members also emphasized that the relatively favorable trends in productivity, costs, and prices continued to raise questions about the strength and timing of any pickup in inflation. Other members stressed that the unsustainable pace of domestic demand and rising resource utilization seemed to call for a near-term tightening of policy. Some of these members noted that overall financial conditions remained quite supportive despite the recent market turmoil and high real short-term interest rates. Credit from a wide variety of lenders appeared to be amply available on favorable terms, perhaps overly so in present circumstances. Nonetheless, all but one of the members believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging. In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action.  In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, the members indicated that they wanted to retain in the operating paragraph of the directive the existing asymmetry toward restraint that was initially adopted at the May meeting. Such a directive was consistent with their view that the risks continued to be biased toward rising inflation. Accordingly, the members continued to view the next policy move as more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months. In labor markets, hiring has remained robust and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in October, its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production increased very rapidly in the third quarter, and appears to have remained strong in October. Retail sales also rose sharply in the third quarter, though at a moderating pace as the summer progressed. Housing starts, while fluctuating from month to month, were little changed on balance in the third quarter. Business fixed investment posted unusually strong increases in the latest quarter, and available indicators point to further sizable gains in coming months. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on average in July and August from its rate in the second quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued despite some increase in the pace of advance in labor compensation.  Short-term interest rates have registered small mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting on September 30, 1997, while bond yields have fallen somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets have fluctuated widely in turbulent trading activity and are down on balance over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, have been volatile as well and some have registered very large declines. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated significantly, however, in terms of the currencies of a number of Asian and Latin American countries.  Growth of M2 and M3 appears to have moderated further in October from the unusually brisk rates of August. For the year through October, M2 expanded at the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent months at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.  Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.  Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in view of the recent strength in aggregate demand for goods and services; such demand appeared to be growing considerably more rapidly than the sustainable rate at which it could be supplied without an increase in inflation. While he recognized that a tightening at this meeting presented risks in view of recent financial and economic developments in East Asia, he believed these risks were outweighed by the risk that policy would have to be tightened more aggressively if action were delayed, demand remained robust, and the recent apparent reduction in inflationary expectations were reversed. The negative impact on economic activity in such circumstances would be markedly greater than if a more modest action were taken at this meeting.",199711,0,368,1997-11-30,0.38,0.32,0.07,0.18,0.94,0.85,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1997-11-12

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to grow at a rapid pace in recent months. The further advance reflected moderating but still sizable increases in business fixed investment and consumer spending and an upturn in business inventory accumulation. Housing demand remained at a high level, and deepening trade deficits provided only a partial offset to the strength in domestic spending. Against this background, employment and production posted further large gains. Price inflation remained subdued despite tight labor markets and some pickup in the rate of wage increases.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply further in October and November. The increases in payrolls were widespread across sectors, and in November they included notably large gains in the service- producing industries. Manufacturing employment also rose considerably further in November, and aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers registered a particularly large advance in that month. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, its low for the current expansion.  Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in October and November. The November increase was widespread across market groups. It featured particularly strong growth in the production of durable goods, including a surge in the output of motor vehicles and parts. Partly offsetting the strength in the manufacturing sector in November was a decline in mining activity and in utilities output after two months of robust expansion. The large rise in production boosted the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity to its highest level in more than two years.  Growth in consumer spending had moderated in recent months from a very brisk pace during the summer. Retail sales were unchanged on balance over October and November after having increased rapidly in the third quarter. The flat sales for the two months reflected some softening in the durable goods category, notably at automotive dealers, and relatively slow growth in the nondurable goods sector. Consumer spending on services appeared to have remained relatively robust in October. According to recent surveys, consumer sentiment remained at an extraordinarily ebullient level in the context of continuing strong gains in jobs and incomes, the cumulative effect of large increases in household net worth, and the ready availability of financing for most consumers.  Available information suggested that business capital expenditures had moderated in recent months from the exceptionally strong increases of the second and third quarters. Shipments of office and computing equipment fell in nominal terms in October, while shipments of communications equipment were about unchanged after having posted strong gains earlier in the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and high-tech equipment also declined in October. Spending on nonresidential structures had softened a bit in recent months.  In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions. In October, the latest month for which data were available, sales of new homes were well maintained, and sales of existing homes rose. Housing starts increased somewhat in October and November from the already high level reached earlier in the year.  After picking up considerably in September, the pace of business inventory investment in October remained above that recorded earlier in the summer. The rise in stocks at the manufacturing level was at a somewhat faster pace in October than in September, but the buildup in inventories at the wholesale level, and especially at the retail level, moderated in October. On balance, inventories remained at quite low levels in relation to shipments and sales.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was significantly larger in the third quarter than in the second. Exports of goods and services rose only marginally in the third quarter, as increases in machinery, industrial supplies, and service receipts were nearly offset by sharp declines in exports of aircraft and gold. Imports of goods and services rose appreciably in the third quarter; the increases were in most major trade categories and included strong further advances in the quantity of oil imports. Economic growth in most major foreign industrial countries was relatively vigorous in the third quarter, and preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter suggested continued above-trend expansion. However, growth since midyear appeared to have recovered only modestly in Japan from a sharp second-quarter decline. The ongoing financial turmoil affecting a number of Asian economies had led to a significant slowdown in economic activity in the region. Available data also suggested a favorable economic performance in major Latin American countries in the third quarter.  Consumer price inflation had remained at a low level in recent months, reflecting a variety of influences including a favorable labor cost environment, falling import prices, small increases in energy prices, and declining inflation expectations. For the twelve months ended in November, overall consumer prices and consumer prices excluding food and energy items increased appreciably less than in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices for finished goods edged lower in November and the index was down somewhat on balance over the past year, reflecting declines in the food and energy components. The rate of increase in average hourly earnings had picked up in recent months, apparently reflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage and some bidding up of wages in a tight labor market.  At its meeting on November 12, 1997, the Committee had adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging around 5-1/2 percent. In the directive the Committee had retained a tilt toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Such a bias had been seen as consistent with the members' views that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. Reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations throughout the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the intended average of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal funds rate, and the average effective rate over the period was close to that rate level. In other domestic financial markets, short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting on November 12, 1997, while bond yields fell somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets recorded mixed changes over the period. Domestic financial markets became somewhat less volatile over the period, though further turmoil in a number of foreign markets fostered a sense of unease that was reflected in relatively wide yield spreads and, on occasion, in trading activity and price movements. Equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, remained volatile.  In foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar rose over the intermeeting period in terms of both the trade-weighted index of the other G-10 currencies and the currencies of a number of Asian countries. The dollar's appreciation against the German mark and other Western European currencies appeared to reflect market perceptions that the prospects for monetary tightening had ebbed in those countries in light of the persistence of subdued inflation and indications that the continuing financial turmoil in Asian and other emerging economies was likely to have a retarding effect on the economies of the industrial countries. The dollar's appreciation relative to the yen appeared to reflect rising concerns about the Japanese economy in the wake of continuing financial difficulties in Japan and spillover effects from events elsewhere in Asia. The dollar strengthened further in this period against most of the other East Asian currencies, notably against the Korean won.  Growth in the broad monetary aggregates picked up to relatively rapid rates in November. Strength in currency and a surge in liquid deposits boosted the expansion of M2, while that of M3 was amplified by a step-up in RP borrowing to help finance more rapid growth in bank credit. For the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate that was slightly above the upper bound of the Committee's annual range, and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. The increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year to date was at a pace somewhat below the middle of the Committee's range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested somewhat greater moderation in economic expansion than had been projected earlier and slightly less pressure on wages and prices. A number of factors were expected to contribute to the slowing of aggregate demand and reduced pressure on resources. These included: a slackening in world economic expansion that, in conjunction with the appreciation of the dollar, would substantially restrain U.S. exports; some moderation of the growth in household and business investment; and a diminution in the desired rate of inventory accumulation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on indications that growth in economic activity had remained solid and that inflation had continued to be surprisingly low. While wages appeared to be increasingly subject to upward pressure, productivity had picked up in recent quarters, and the persisting strength in profits suggested that unit labor costs were not accelerating noticeably. The evidently higher pace of productivity growth was very encouraging, though it was still difficult to assess how long this favorable performance might last and the extent to which it might ease the price pressures that could emerge if the economic expansion did not moderate as members anticipated. Domestic demand for goods and services had been quite strong and was likely to remain reasonably robust. However, the effects of the persisting turmoil in Asian financial markets were likely to moderate the pace of expansion, though the extent of this effect was difficult to judge. The ongoing turbulence since the last Committee meeting, which included further noticeable increases in the dollar against the currencies of affected countries, likely would have a somewhat greater damping effect on output and prices in the United States than previously had been anticipated. Exports to many Asian countries, and possibly to other U.S. trading partners whose economies might be adversely affected by the spillover effects of developments in Asia, would be reduced, and declines in import prices would ease inflation pressures. However, the ultimate extent of the adjustment in Asian economies remained unknown, and more substantial downward pressure on the economies of the United States and its trading partners could not be ruled out.  With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, the members noted that the appreciation of the dollar against a wide range of currencies, along with the prospective slackening in world economic expansion associated with the Asian turmoil, could be expected to exert a considerable damping effect on U.S. exports over the next several quarters. In addition, increased uncertainty about financial asset values, possibly related in part to further difficulties in Asia, could lead to greater caution in spending, while a substantial decline in equity values, should it occur, would have a more pronounced effect by reducing household wealth and raising the cost of equity capital. However, a number of members suggested that consumer spending might hold up relatively well if the effects of the Asian crisis on the U.S. economy were not markedly deeper or more prolonged than currently expected. To date, anecdotal reports indicated only scattered signs of weaker export demand, primarily some slackening in orders for and shipments of selected commodities such as agricultural goods and lumber and wood products, and there were few indications of reduced demand for manufactured goods. At the same time, business contacts were optimistic about holiday sales, tourism was booming in some parts of the country, and spending for services had been brisk. In the circumstances, continuing gains in wages and employment, the prevailing high levels of confidence, the cumulative effects of very large increases in household wealth in recent years, and the intense competition among retailers for the consumer's attention could promote substantial further growth in consumer expenditures. The same factors, along with the favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership, were maintaining housing demand at a relatively high level.  The outlook for business fixed investment remained favorable. In the near term, the low cost of capital, the ready availability of finance on attractive terms, and the potential for reducing production costs in highly competitive markets were providing strong support for capital spending. Moreover, shrinking vacancy rates and rising lease rates were fostering a rapid increase in the number of large commercial building projects, notably office buildings, that were planned or under way in many areas of the country. Even so, the growth of business capital spending was expected to slow from the unusually rapid pace of recent quarters in response to the projected smaller increases in sales and profits arising from moderating economic growth. In addition, business firms were expected to trim the pace of their inventory accumulation to keep stocks at desired levels relative to sales.  In their comments on recent developments in labor markets, the members emphasized the very limited supply of new workers and the extraordinary tightness prevailing in markets throughout the nation. Several reported that the scarcity of available workers was limiting the growth of economic activity in some parts of the country and that some employers were trying out novel approaches aimed at enticing people not currently seeking a job to enter the work force. While wage increases remained moderate on balance, larger increases were gradually becoming more pervasive as labor markets tightened. Moreover, employers were continuing their efforts to attract or retain workers that were in particularly scarce supply by means of a variety of bonus payments and other incentives that were not included in standard measures of labor compensation. There also were reports of offers of expanded benefits and, in some instances, the granting of very large wage increases to highly skilled technical personnel.  In the course of their discussion, many members remarked on the absence of inflationary price pressures during a period when economic activity had risen briskly and labor markets had grown steadily tighter. The muted effect of higher labor compensation on unit labor costs and prices reflected sharp advances in productivity partly associated with the rapid expansion of the stock of capital; the latter had been stimulated, most probably, by the desire to enhance efficiency and thus hold down costs. In addition, the earlier appreciation of the dollar and the unusually damped increases in the cost of health benefits in recent years had helped to limit the rise in compensation.  As members had noted at previous meetings, these favorable influences were likely to erode over time. Anecdotal reports indicated that health insurance premiums were beginning to trend higher, and the dollar would not rise indefinitely. More fundamentally, persistent tightness in labor markets risked a continuing uptrend in labor compensation increases that, at some point, could not be fully offset by productivity gains. Under those circumstances, competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to compensate for increases in their costs. However, for some period ahead, developments associated with the turmoil in Asia along with the partly related appreciation of the dollar would tend to intensify import competition and damp the prices of goods.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members favored a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. In their discussion, members emphasized that price inflation had remained subdued, indeed with some key price measures indicating declining inflation, despite the persistence of robust economic growth and high levels of resource use, notably in labor markets. They expressed concern, however, that multiplying indications of faster wage increases might presage rising price inflation at some point. Weighing against the risks of higher inflation was the financial turmoil that had intensified in Southeast Asia during October and more recently in Korea. The effects of those developments on the U.S. economy were quite limited thus far, but the members expected some damping of economic expansion and price increases in the quarters ahead and they did not rule out a potentially strong impact in the event of an even deeper crisis in Asia, or one that spread to other countries. Nonetheless, many members commented that, with domestic demand still quite strong and the economy possibly producing beyond its potential, they viewed the risks on balance as pointing to rising price inflation and the next policy move as likely to be in the direction of some tightening. However, most members agreed that the need for such a policy adjustment did not appear to be imminent, and that prevailing near-term uncertainties warranted a cautious wait-and-see policy posture. One member, while acknowledging the downside risks to the expansion associated with potential developments in Asia, still was persuaded that the economy probably would continue to expand at an unsustainable pace and that monetary policy should be tightened promptly to avert a further buildup of pressures in already strained labor markets, associated increases in labor costs, and at some point an inevitable rise in price inflation.  Other considerations cited by some members in favor of an unchanged policy included the possibility that, because a policy tightening move was not expected at this juncture, even a modest firming action might well have outsized effects in financial markets, especially the foreign exchange markets. Current conditions in domestic financial markets clearly remained supportive of spending, but it also was noted that the real federal funds rate was relatively high and that growth in the broad measures of money was expected to moderate over coming months after a period of robust expansion. The members agreed that the crosscurrents that were generating the present uncertainties in the outlook for economic activity and inflation made a flexible approach to monetary policy particularly desirable at this juncture.  Views were somewhat more divided with regard to the instruction in the directive relating to the possible adjustment of policy during the intermeeting period. A majority of the members indicated a preference for a shift to a symmetrical directive even though many continued to anticipate that the next policy move was likely to be in a tightening direction. They noted that while the probability of any policy change in the near term was very low, uncertainties in the outlook had increased, and they could not rule out the possibility that the next change might be in the direction of some easing if, contrary to current expectations, the turmoil in Asia were to intensify to the extent that it seemed likely to exert very substantial effects on the U.S. economy. A symmetric directive would position the Committee to respond flexibly in either direction to unanticipated developments in the period ahead. Other members expressed a slight preference for retaining a directive that was tilted toward tightening. In their view, such a directive would continue to underscore their concern that at current and prospective levels of resource utilization, rising inflation was the most serious risk to the economy and the Committee remained committed to fostering progress toward a stable price environment that in turn would heighten the prospects for sustained economic expansion and full employment.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member endorsed a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in October and November; the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in October and November. Retail sales were unchanged on balance over the two months after rising sharply in the third quarter. Housing starts increased slightly further in October and November. Available information suggests on balance that business fixed investment will slow from the exceptionally strong increases of the second and third quarters. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened significantly in the third quarter from its rate in the second quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued, despite some increase in the pace of advance in wages.  Short-term interest rates have registered small mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting on November 12, 1997, while bond yields have fallen somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets recorded mixed changes over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile. In foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has risen over the intermeeting period in terms of both the trade-weighted index of the other G-10 countries and the currencies of a number of Asian countries.  M2 and M3 grew rapidly in November. For the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate slightly above the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent months at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.  Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.  Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services. He recognized the case for holding policy steady given recent developments in East Asian economies and financial markets; he believed, however, that a slight firming at this meeting would provide valuable insurance against the risk that demand growth might remain above a sustainable trend and require a sharper policy response later. He thought further that the potential benefits of this insurance outweighed the risk that such an action would have a significant negative impact on U.S. economic activity. He also believed that signaling a greater willingness to tolerate modest policy adjustments in response to emerging developments would foster more flexible movements in longer-term financial markets, and specifically enable longer-term interest rates to play their traditional role as automatic stabilizers for the economy more effectively.",199712,0,369,1997-12-31,0.05,0.08,0.07,-0.12,0.08,0.57,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1997-12-16

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand at a robust pace during the closing months of 1997. Both employment and industrial output recorded substantial increases in the fourth quarter. While spending for final goods and services by U.S. residents decelerated noticeably, inventory investment strengthened and the deficit in international trade in goods and services appeared to have narrowed. Tighter labor markets brought some acceleration in wages, but falling import and energy prices helped to hold down price inflation over the closing months of the year.  Labor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter; a sharp increase in nonfarm payroll employment in December followed large advances in October and November, and the average workweek edged up on balance over the three-month period. Job gains were widely spread across industries. In the fourth quarter, new hires in manufacturing accounted for more than half of that sector's total for the year, and construction employment also registered an unusually large rise compared with earlier in 1997. Job growth surged in retail trade and persisted at a rapid pace in service-producing industries. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent in December, was near its low for the current economic expansion.  Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in the fourth quarter. Growth in the manufacturing of durable goods remained strong despite sharply slower, though still substantial, expansion in the output of computing and office equipment. The production of nondurable goods picked up after having been sluggish earlier in the year. Capacity utilization in manufacturing was at a relatively high rate in the fourth quarter, but available information suggested few bottlenecks.  Consumer spending, in real terms, rose at a slower though still appreciable rate in the fourth quarter. Purchases of durable goods increased moderately after surging in the third quarter, and spending on nondurables edged down. By contrast, expenditures for consumer services grew at a somewhat faster rate. Recent surveys indicated that consumer confidence remained at a very high level.  Housing demand continued to exhibit considerable strength at year-end in the context of sharp declines in fixed mortgage rates in recent months, further sizable gains in employment and household income, and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes increased to a new monthly high in December; the pace of sales of existing homes rose further in the fourth quarter; and sales of new homes in November (latest available monthly data) were at their highest monthly pace in more than ten years. Housing starts edged lower in December but remained close to the highs of the current expansion.  After unusually strong increases earlier in the year, real business fixed investment declined slightly in the fourth quarter. However, the outlook for further growth remained positive, with corporate cash flow still healthy and the user cost of capital still low. Data on shipments of nondefense capital goods in December indicated a rebound in business spending on capital goods, notably for office, computing, and communications equipment, after sizable declines in the October-November period. Business spending on nonresidential structures declined slightly in the fourth quarter despite rising real estate prices and falling vacancy rates.  The pace of business inventory investment evidently picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter. In manufacturing, inventories climbed further in November (latest monthly data available), and the stock-shipments ratio was at the top of its narrow range for the past twelve months. The accumulation of wholesale stocks continued its strong upward trend, and by November the inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector had reversed its 1996 decline. In the retail sector, inventories declined slightly in November after having changed little in October; the inventory-sales ratio for this sector was near the bottom of its range for the last twelve months.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially on average in October and November from its level in the third quarter. The value of exports rose appreciably in the October-November period, with the largest increases occurring in automotive and agricultural products. The average value of imports for October and November changed little from the third-quarter rate. Imports of consumer goods and machinery rose, but they were about offset by declines in automotive products, computers, and, to a lesser extent, a wide variety of other products. The available information indicated that economic expansion remained healthy in most of the foreign G-7 countries, although slowing somewhat from the third quarter. In Asia, weakness in economic activity in Japan continued into the fourth quarter, and persisting financial turmoil was having strong adverse effects on the economies of a number of developing countries.  Consumer price inflation remained low in December, damped by a sizable further drop in energy prices and a small decline in food prices. Excluding food and energy items, an acceleration in the costs of services, notably medical care and shelter, provided a slight boost to core consumer price inflation in December. For the year as a whole, prices of core consumer items rose considerably less than in 1996, in part reflecting the effect of declining import prices. At the producer level, prices of all finished goods and of the core finished goods component declined further in December. For the year 1997, the core producer price index was little changed after a relatively small rise the previous year; the total index, weighed down by falling prices of finished food and energy items, partially reversed its 1996 increase. Prices also remained subdued at earlier stages of processing in 1997, with prices of crude materials falling substantially. Labor costs, as measured by the hourly compensation of private industry workers, increased at appreciably faster rates in the fourth quarter and for the year.  At its meeting on December 16, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging around 5-1/2 percent. In light of the increased uncertainties in the outlook and the possibility that the next change in policy might be in either direction, the Committee adopted a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the intended federal funds rate average of around 5-1/2 percent, and the effective rate averaged close to that level despite some largely anticipated upward pressures in reserve markets around year-end. Most other domestic market interest rates moved down on balance during the intermeeting period, apparently as a result of increased concerns over the turbulence in Asia and its potential implications for the U.S. economy. Share prices in U.S. equity markets moved up slightly on net, perhaps partly in response to the bond market rally, while equity markets in some other countries, notably in Asia, remained unsettled.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar rose considerably further against the currencies of many of the emerging market economies in Asia amid continuing market concerns about the adequacy of reforms that would be undertaken in the affected countries and the magnitude and availability of international financial assistance that would be needed to support those efforts. The dollar also gained slightly on average in relation to the currencies of the other G-10 currencies. A sizable advance by the dollar relative to the German mark was largely reversed late in the intermeeting period; incoming information suggesting greater strength in the German economy lifted the value of the mark and tended to offset growing concern about the likely effect of the Asian crisis on Germany. The dollar declined somewhat on balance against the yen as heightened prospects for domestic fiscal stimulus in Japan fostered hopes of a less weak performance of the Japanese economy.  M2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid rates in December and apparently also in January. Recent gains in nominal income evidently underpinned much of the greater-than-expected strength in M2 in January; also contributing were a pickup in mortgage refinancing activity and, perhaps, depositor transfers of funds from market instruments whose yields had declined relative to those on M2 assets. Large increases in repurchase agreements contributed to rapid growth of M3 in January; the rise in M3 helped to finance further solid expansion of bank credit. From the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997, M2 increased at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range, reflecting the slow rise in the federal debt.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. The staff analysis suggested that slower growth abroad and the considerable rise that already had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would exert substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and subject domestic producers to even stiffer competition from imports. An anticipated reduction in the desired rate of inventory accumulation would add to the restraint on the expansion. As output growth slowed, pressures on resources would be expected to diminish somewhat. None- theless, it was expected that, consistently measured, inflation would increase to some degree over the ensuing period through 1999, owing in part to an abatement of restraining forces from foreign exchange and oil markets.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the performance of the economy continued to be quite favorable. They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate. Nonetheless, their assessments of the various factors bearing on the outlook led them to conclude that appreciably slower economic growth was in the offing for the year ahead, possibly to a pace in the vicinity of current estimates of the economy's long- run growth potential. Many emphasized that the prospects for declining net exports as a consequence of the dollar's appreciation and the crises in a number of Asian economies were a key factor in the outlook for some slowing in the expansion. In addition, a moderating rate of inventory accumulation appeared likely after the rapid buildup during 1997. At the same time, high levels of confidence and generally accommodative financial conditions supported expectations of persisting, though likely diminishing, strength in consumer spending and business fixed investment. The members acknowledged that their forecasts were subject to a great deal of uncertainty since there was little precedent to guide them in their evaluation of the extent and likely effect of Asian market turmoil. In the circumstances, the risks of a considerable deviation on the upside or the downside of their current forecasts were unusually high. Partly as a consequence, the outlook for inflation was quite tentative as well. Moreover, questions persisted about the level and growth of sustainable output. Members observed that price inflation had remained subdued, and by some measures had declined, in recent months despite very tight labor markets and indications of somewhat faster increases in labor compensation.  In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year ahead. Based on developments over the second half of 1997, the central tendency of the projections for 1998 now pointed to slightly more strength in real GDP and appreciably less inflation than the forecasts prepared at the time of the July 1997 meeting. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1998 had a central tendency of 2 to 2-3/4 percent and a full range of 1-3/4 to 3 percent. Such growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, implying little or no change from the current level. With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1998, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-1/2 to 5 percent. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices. These forecasts took account of likely further technical improvements in the CPI by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that would trim the reported rate. The projections were based on individual views concerning what would be an appropriate policy over the projection horizon to foster the Committee's longer-term goals.  The members stressed that the potential extent of the negative effects of developments in Asia on the nation's trade balance represented a key uncertainty in the economic outlook. On the whole, those effects had been quite limited thus far. Anecdotal reports indicated that a number of domestic producers, notably of agricul- tural, lumber, and wood products, had experienced some cancellations or postponements of orders from Asian customers and there was some evidence of increased imports from those nations. Exports to affected Asian nations were likely to be held back by declining incomes and rising prices of U.S. products in local currencies, and reportedly also by difficulties that importing firms in Asia were encountering in securing financing. The eventual effects of the Asian financial turmoil on the U.S. trade balance and the overall economy were unknown--in part because in some key countries needed reforms had yet to be implemented and markets to stabilize--but they clearly seemed likely to become more pronounced in coming months. Net exports also would be held down by the appreciation of the dollar against the currencies of the industrial countries that had occurred earlier in 1997 before the Asian crisis intensified.  Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment. In the past year, businesses had added to inventories at a rate that exceeded the rise in final sales, and somewhat reduced accumulation to a pace more in line with that of final sales was seen as a reasonable expectation. Some members expressed reservations, however, about the extent of any weakening in inventory accumulation in light of the relatively favorable economic conditions that they believed were likely to persist over the year ahead.  Members viewed further growth in consumer spending as likely to remain the major factor in sustaining the expansion in overall economic activity. Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of recent years. Some also noted that consumer debt burdens, while large, were manageable and that such burdens would be lessened for many consumers by their refinancing of home mortgages at the lower mortgage rates now prevailing. Evidence of strength in the consumer sector was supported by upbeat anecdotal reports of retail sales during the holiday season and more recently. While the growth in personal expenditures was likely to moderate somewhat from its recent pace, members did not rule out a more ebullient consumer sector in the context of substantial further growth in disposable incomes, favorable financing conditions for purchases of homes, automobiles, and other consumer durables, and the high level of stock market prices.  Business fixed investment also was expected to provide substantial support to continued economic expansion, though some moderation in purchases of business equipment seemed likely after the exceptionally rapid rates of growth in such investments in recent years. Business sentiment remained generally optimistic, and both debt and equity financing continued to be readily available on attractive terms to most business borrowers. However, early signs of faltering profit trends in some industries, in part related to developments in Asia, appeared to have introduced a cautionary note among some business planners. Members also referred to emerging signs of speculative overbuilding in some areas, especially of commercial structures. Even so, in the absence of unanticipated weakness in consumer expenditures, a variety of favorable factors seemed likely to sustain relatively robust spending on business structures and equipment over the year ahead. The latter included increased opportunities to cut costs and enhance efficiency by investing in relatively inexpensive high-tech equipment in a period characterized by strong competition in many markets and rising labor compensation associated with tight labor markets.  Residential construction activity had remained relatively robust in recent months and was expected to be well maintained over coming quarters. Positive indications for the housing outlook included relatively low mortgage interest rates, very favorable measures of cash-flow affordability, and quite positive home-buying attitudes as expressed in recent surveys. While these factors were expected to help sustain the housing sector over coming months, members noted that housing construction had been high for some time and some cited anecdotal evidence of softening activity in some parts of the country. On balance, only modest, if any, slippage from current levels of home construction activity seemed likely over the year ahead.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation. Labor cost increases in recent quarters had been especially rapid in a large segment of the service sector, where foreign competition was not a factor. Some members commented, however, that there were reasons to discount the sharp fourth-quarter increase in the employment cost index because to a large extent it was the result of nonrecurring developments in a limited number of industries. Despite the upward trend in labor compensation, gains in productivity clearly had kept increases in unit labor costs at a very modest level; and with unit nonlabor costs continuing to decline, overall unit cost increases had remained not far above zero. In these circumstances--and in the context of highly competitive conditions in many markets, declines in input prices and in the prices of many commodities, including oil--rising labor costs seemed to pose little risk of an upward impetus to inflation in coming months.  The longer-run outlook for inflation was more clouded and under some scenarios less promising. Inflation expectations had been moving down according to recent surveys, and in the context of relatively modest increases in consumer prices expected over coming months such expectations could continue to move lower, thereby constraining increases in compensation and prices. Nonetheless, some of the factors that had helped to moderate price increases--including declining oil prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and restrained increases in health insurance costs--were not likely to continue to exert benign effects on inflation as time went on. More fundamentally, the productivity improvement that had held down producer costs could not necessarily be counted on to continue to offset such costs, especially if the economic expansion remained sufficiently rapid to put additional pressures on available labor resources.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. The economy currently was performing very well and the outlook over the near term was for subdued inflation and continued solid economic growth. Over a longer horizon, the range of possible outcomes was unusually wide, and the direction that policy would need to move to promote sustained expansion and damped inflation was unclear. At this point, the extent to which the still largely anticipated external drag from events in Asia would offset the strong upward momentum in domestic demand was a source of major uncertainty. In addition, it was impossible to predict whether or when the tightness in labor markets would exert a more pronounced effect on labor costs and ultimately on price inflation. Even the thrust of the current stance of monetary policy as it was transmitted through financial markets was open to some question. On the one hand, a real federal funds rate that was on the high side of historical experience and a substantially stronger dollar suggested some restraint. From a different perspective, however, financial conditions seemed to be quite stimulative as evidenced by lower nominal and perhaps real intermediate and long-term interest rates, rising equity prices, ready credit availability, and rapid growth of the broad measures of money and credit. While the members differed to some extent in their forecasts of major trends in the economy and in the risks of alternative outcomes, they agreed that, under foreseeable circumstances, needed adjustments to policy probably could be made on a timely basis once the balance of underlying forces became more evident. Accordingly, a steady policy would not incur an unacceptable risk of a seriously deteriorating economic performance. In the interim, the greater risk would be to make a preemptive policy move on the basis of inadequate evidence regarding underlying economic trends.  In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy, all the members agreed that prevailing uncertainties indicated the desirability of retaining a symmetric instruction in the directive. While a number of members expressed the view that the next policy move was likely to be a tightening action and one member saw a greater probability of an easing action, the uncertainties were sufficiently great to warrant remaining sensitive to the need for a policy change in either direction. Accordingly, a symmetric directive would signal the Committee's readiness to respond promptly to developments that might threaten the economy's satisfactory performance.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated their support of a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent, and all also favored a directive that did not include a presumption about the direction of a change, if any, in the stance of policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the members decided that a slightly higher or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during the closing months of 1997. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in December after posting very large gains in other recent months; the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, remained near its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending rose appreciably in the quarter, and housing starts remained close to the highs of the current expansion. Business fixed investment weakened following exceptionally strong increases in the second and third quarters; nonfarm inventory accumulation appears to have picked up somewhat. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed significantly on average in October and November from its level in the third quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued despite appreciably faster increases in worker compensation in recent months.  Most interest rates have declined on balance since the day before the Committee meeting on December 16, 1997. Share prices in U.S. equity markets have moved up somewhat over the period; equity markets in some other countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile. In foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has risen over the intermeeting period relative to the currencies of several Asian developing countries, but it has registered only a small increase on average in relation to the currencies of major industrial nations.  M2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid rates in December and apparently also in January. From the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

Apparently, strong growth in private domestic spending for consumption, housing, and business equipment more than offset weakness in net exports and a slight moderation in inventory investment. Total employment continued to rise rapidly, but industrial production increased at a considerably slower pace. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation abated further, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply further in January and February. Growth in construction jobs was particularly strong, apparently reflecting in part the unseasonably warm weather across much of the country and the need to repair damage caused by ice storms and heavy rains. In addition, service industries continued to post very large employment gains. By contrast, manufacturing payrolls contracted slightly in February after a sizable increase in January. The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 4.6 percent in February, equaling its low for the current economic expansion.  Industrial production edged up on balance in January and February after having increased rapidly in the second half of 1997. Part of the deceleration stemmed from the depressing effect of unusually warm winter weather on the provision of heating services by utilities. The growth of manufacturing production also slowed considerably as a result of downward adjustments to assemblies of motor vehicles and, more generally, weakness in the output of business equipment. With investment in new manufacturing facilities still brisk and manufacturing output posting only a small advance in the January-February period, the factory operating rate eased a little.  Consumers stepped up their spending in the early months of the year; sentiment remained buoyant in the context of continued strong growth in disposable income and further gains in household wealth. Particularly large increases were recorded in expenditures on durable goods, apparel, and general merchandise. Housing demand also strengthened, with sales of existing homes reaching a record high in February and sales of new homes in January (latest data) almost equaling the previous record. Both housing starts and building permits remained on an upward trend.  Business fixed investment seemed to have rebounded from a small decline in the fourth quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods, notably of computing equipment whose prices continued to fall sharply, strengthened substantially in January and February. By contrast, expenditures on transportation equipment were sluggish. Despite further declines in vacancy rates and rising real estate prices, business spending on nonresidential construction also seemed to have been lackluster, with such activity not having changed much since last summer.  The pace of business inventory accumulation slowed sharply in January from the fourth-quarter rate. Some of the slowdown reflected a reduction in motor vehicle stocks; the remainder was largely associated with a drop in inventories of nondurable goods at the wholesale level. Inventory-sales ratios for most manufacturing and trade categories were within the ranges experienced over the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its average monthly level for the fourth quarter. The value of exports declined considerably, partly as a result of reduced exports to Asia, but the value of imports changed little. The decrease in exports was mainly in civilian aircraft and other capital goods. The available information indicated that the pace of economic expansion picked up in Europe after having slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter and was still strong on balance in Canada. Economic activity remained weak in Japan and decelerated sharply in Asian countries that had been the focus of financial turmoil.  Consumer prices were little changed on balance in January and February, as substantial declines in energy prices largely offset increases elsewhere. Excluding food and energy items, consumer price inflation picked up somewhat in the first two months of the year from the pace of the second half of 1997; on a year-over-year basis, however, the increase in consumer prices during the twelve months ended in February was slightly smaller than that in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, falling prices for finished energy goods in January and February pulled down the index of prices for all finished items; excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged on balance over the two months. Over the twelve months ended in February, producer price inflation was negligible. Tight labor markets appeared to be putting some upward pressure on labor compensation, but the pickup was limited. The change in average hourly earnings over the twelve months ended in February was only slightly larger than the increase over the year-earlier period.  With economic growth still solid and inflation subdued, the Committee at its meeting on February 3-4, 1998, had adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. The substantial uncertainties about the future strength of economic activity and inflation suggested that the next change in policy could be in either direction, and the Committee also had agreed that the directive should not contain a presumption about the direction of any change in the stance of policy during the intermeeting period. The reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations throughout the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the intended average for the federal funds rate of around 5-1/2 percent, and the rate fluctuated in a narrow range around that level. By contrast, interest rates in other domestic financial markets generally rose somewhat on balance over the period in response to incoming information that suggested aggregate private demand remained robust. Despite the rise in rates and some erosion in the outlook for near-term corporate profits, share prices in U.S. equity markets moved up substantially further.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period in relation to the currencies of the other major industrial countries. Against a background of weakening growth in Japan and continued uncertainty about the prospects for fiscal stimulus in that country, the dollar rose considerably against the yen. The dollar changed little against the mark and other continental European currencies but declined against the Canadian dollar and the British pound. The dollar also depreciated significantly relative to the currencies of several emerging market economies in Asia, reflecting market assessments that progress had been made in reforming economic policies and financial and commercial practices in most of those countries.  The available information for February and part of March indicated that M2 and M3 expanded more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated at the time of its February meeting. On a quarterly average basis, growth of both monetary aggregates picked up somewhat in the first quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter. The increased demand for M2 was perhaps associated in part with the reduced attractiveness of longer-term fixed rate market assets, whose yields had declined significantly relative to the returns on liquid investment components of M2. In addition, households might have been trying to rebalance asset portfolios that had become more heavily weighted in equities as a result of the run-up in stock prices. The pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in bank issuance of large time deposits to finance strong demands for loans by businesses and households. The expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also strengthened over recent months in response to heavy private demands for credit.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. The staff analysis suggested that the surge in household net worth over the past several years would help to support sizable, though gradually diminishing, gains in consumer spending; favorable cash flow affordability would underpin housing demand at a relatively high level; and substantial increases in capital spending would persist until slower growth in business sales and weaker profits began to have a restraining effect in 1999. Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the considerable rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to exert substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports over the projection period and to increase the pressures on domestic producers that face import competition. An anticipated slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would restrain domestic production as stocks were brought into balance with the expected lower trajectory for sales. Although pressures on production resources would abate to a degree as output growth slowed, inflation was expected to increase somewhat in response to persisting tightness in labor markets and a diminishing drag from non-oil import prices.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members commented on the persistence of unusually favorable economic conditions, characterized by strong growth and low inflation, but a number questioned how long these conditions might last without a policy adjustment. Domestic demand was exceeding expectations and was likely to continue to increase rapidly for some time, supported by accommodative conditions in key segments of financial markets. Developments in foreign trade were moderating demands on domestic resources; but with domestic spending strong, members were becoming more concerned that those developments might not exert enough restraint on aggregate demand to slow the expansion to a sustainable pace in line with the growth of the economy's potential. Despite tightening labor markets, inflation prospects remained quite favorable for a while as a number of factors--some temporary--helped to damp near-term pressures on prices. Nonetheless, in the absence of some slowing in the expansion, labor compensation probably would continue to accelerate and increasingly outpace productivity, adding to pressures on prices.  In their review of the outlook for spending in key sectors of the domestic economy, members saw little reason to anticipate substantial slowing in the growth of consumer or business expenditures in coming quarters, and they also expected housing activity to be maintained at a relatively high level. The recent further increases in equity prices from already high levels played an important role in the assessments of several members. The stock market's rise was viewed as somewhat puzzling, given indications of some slowing in the growth of profits and the potential for earnings disappointments as the expansion in spending moderated and profit margins narrowed in the context of more rapid labor cost increases. So long as a high degree of optimism in the stock market persisted, however, the elevated level of financial wealth and the low cost of capital should continue to boost spending. Consumer expenditures, especially for durable goods, had risen sharply thus far this year, and the factors that had fueled that expansion were still unusually positive. They included large increases in employment and personal incomes, the continuing uptrend in financial wealth relative to disposable income, and, in these circumstances, the persistence of a very high level of consumer confidence. Attractive financing conditions and favorable business confidence also were expected to support substantial further growth in business investment, especially in ""high-tech"" equipment that was characterized by rapid product improvement and falling prices. Investment in nonresidential structures, notably in office and other commercial markets, seemed likely to strengthen somewhat in response to reduced vacancy rates and sizable increases in rents in many areas; indeed, several members again reported indications of speculative nonresidential construction in some parts of the country. Residential construction was expected to be maintained at a high level, though single-family starts might soften over the next few months after a surge that appeared to have been related to relatively favorable weather conditions during the winter. With mortgage rates at their recent reduced levels and incomes continuing to rise, the cash flow affordability of home ownership was exceptionally favorable.  Developments in two areas of expenditures were thought likely to exert some restraining effect on the overall expansion in economic activity over coming quarters. One was business inventory accumulation, which had exceeded the robust growth in final sales in 1997 and probably would moderate this year as business firms sought to restrain the buildup in their inventories to keep them in better alignment with the expected moderation of gains in sales.  The second, foreign trade developments, also was likely to have a damping influence on the domestic economy. While the lagged effects of the dollar's appreciation and economic conditions in key U.S. trading partners around the world were important factors in this assessment, members focused in this discussion on the effects of weakness in several Asian economies. Conditions in Japan and in key emerging market economies in Asia were still quite fragile, adjustments on the real side of the economy were just beginning to be felt in some cases, and outcomes for economic growth and exchange rates were still very much in doubt. Nonetheless, some progress had been made in putting recovery programs together and financial markets had seemed to stabilize in several countries. Anecdotal reports of adverse repercussions on individual U.S. firms from the Asian financial turmoil had increased somewhat since the Committee's previous meeting, but the direct overall impact on the U.S. economy was still limited. Indeed, developments in Asia also appeared to have had positive, albeit indirect, effects on domestic demand and prices in the near term by exerting some downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and world oil prices. Prices in the United States of a number of Asian goods and of domestic products competing with those goods had been lowered. Over time, conditions in key Asian economies were thought likely to have a more pronounced retarding effect on the U.S. economy. While the eventual dimensions of that effect remained uncertain, a number of members commented that, on the basis of developments to date, they might turn out to be less negative than had been expected earlier, or at least that some ""worst case"" outcomes seemed less likely.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, members observed that price inflation remained quite low--in fact, it was still declining by some measures--and there was little evidence of any potential acceleration in current price data or in anecdotal reports from around the country. Nonetheless, as they had at previous meetings, members expressed particular concern about the outlook for prices in the absence of appreciable slowing in the growth of aggregate demand, which appeared to be adding to pressures on labor resources. Anecdotal reports from across the nation continued to suggest exceptionally tight labor markets and growing indications of somewhat faster increases in labor compensation. To date, unit labor costs had been contained by large capital investments and other initiatives that had raised the productivity of labor. But additional improvements in productivity growth could not be counted on to offset further increases in the rate of growth of labor compensation, which were more likely to occur especially if labor markets were to tighten further. Moreover, the effects of a number of special factors that had tended to limit cost pressures and price inflation in recent years were not likely to persist; these included the declines in world oil prices, the subdued increases in the costs of health benefits, and the lagged effects of the appreciation of the dollar. To be sure, the factors that had produced the favorable inflation results of recent years were not all well understood, and consequently expectations of greater price pressures had to be tentative. On balance, though any upsurge in inflation seemed unlikely in the nearer term, the risk that inflation might move higher over the longer run seemed to have increased.  Despite perceptions of a greater risk of rising inflation over time, all but one of the members indicated in the Committee's policy discussion that they preferred or could accept a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance that also included a shift from the current symmetrical directive to an asymmetrical directive tilted toward restraint. The members agreed that should the strength of the economic expansion and the firming of labor markets persist, policy tightening likely would be needed at some point to head off imbalances that over time would undermine the expansion in economic activity. Most saw little urgency to tighten policy at this meeting, however. The economy might well continue to accommodate relatively robust economic growth and a high level of resource use for an extended period without a rise in inflation. Some members noted that price increases would be held down for a while by the effects of the higher dollar, which had not worked their way fully through domestic prices. Moreover, inflation continued to fall by some measures and inflation expectations still seemed to be adjusting downward toward actual inflation; further declines in these expectations would restrain increases in compensation and prices. Members also noted that the ultimate extent of retarding effects from the financial turmoil in Asia was still uncertain, and several cited the possibility of a downward adjustment in the stock market, perhaps in response to disappointing growth in business profits, that could have an adverse impact on business and consumer confidence. In these circumstances, a preemptive policy move to head off rising inflation could prove premature or perhaps even unwarranted; indeed, in the view of some, a tightening move was not inevitable. Moreover, because a policy action was not currently anticipated, some commented that a tightening could produce an outsized and undesirable response in financial markets. On balance, in light of the uncertainties in the outlook and given that a variety of special factors would continue to contain inflation for a time, the Committee could await further developments bearing on the strength of inflationary pressures without incurring a significant risk that disruptive policy actions would be needed later in response to an upturn in inflation and inflation expectations.  One member indicated a strong preference for an immediate policy tightening move, largely on the grounds that under current conditions relatively rapid growth in money and credit was not consistent with continued progress toward reducing inflation. A number of other members also commented that the strength of the monetary aggregates, especially if it should persist, was suggesting ample liquidity and accommodative financial conditions. In addition, some cited ebullient equity markets and narrow risk spreads in credit markets as additional evidence that financial conditions were not restraining final demands very much. These were factors that they would weigh in their evaluation of the need for, and timing of, a policy tightening move.  The members agreed that they should be particularly sensitive to developments that might signal rising inflation pressures, and in that regard a shift to an asymmetric directive seemed desirable. Such a directive would be consistent with the Committee's judgment that the information that had become available since a symmetric directive was last adopted in February had altered the inflation risks enough to make some tightening a likely prospect in the not too distant future. In that regard several suggested that the need for some policy tightening could well materialize in the near future.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one member supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that contained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during the early months of 1998. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent in February, equaled its low for the current economic expansion. However, growth in manufacturing payroll employment was down over the first two months of the year, and factory output decelerated appreciably. Consumer spending has risen considerably further since year-end, and housing activity also has strengthened in recent months. Available indicators point to a sharp rebound in business fixed investment following a small decline in the fourth quarter. Fragmentary data on nonfarm inventories suggest a slower rate of accumulation early in the year. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation has abated further, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices.  Interest rates generally have risen somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period. Share prices in U.S. equity markets have moved up substantially further over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has increased somewhat over the period in relation to the currencies of other major industrial nations, but it has depreciated relative to the currencies of most emerging market economies in Asia.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up somewhat in the first quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also has strengthened over recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic non- financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley, Meyer, Mses. Minehan, Phillips, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin.  Votes against this action: Mr. Jordan.  Mr. Jordan dissented because growth rates of various measures of money and credit in the second half of 1997 and the first quarter of this year were not consistent in his view with continued progress in reducing inflation. Recent price statistics understated the trend rates of inflation. The one-time effects of falling oil prices, lower food prices, and recent appreciation of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets provided only a temporary reduction of inflation. While some reacceleration of reported rates of inflation was probably unavoidable, sustained rapid money growth would risk even higher inflation in future years. The durability of the economic expansion would be jeopardized by price and wage decisions reflecting expectations that the purchasing power of the dollar would decline at faster rates in the future. Once such expectations became imbedded in the economy, even stronger policy actions would be required in order to reestablish a downward trend of inflation.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 19, 1998.",199803,0,372,1998-03-31,-0.09,-0.03,0.09,0.04,0.01,0.31,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1998-03-31

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand rapidly in 1998. Strength in consumption, business outlays for durable equipment, and homebuilding boosted growth in domestic final demand to a very rapid pace in the first quarter, and there had been indications of slower expansion since then. However, weakening net exports were exerting a considerable drag on economic growth. Moreover, the extraordinary pace of inventory investment thus far this year might foreshadow less robust expansion ahead. Payroll employment remained on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production decelerated sharply after surging in the second half of last year. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, consumer price inflation remained subdued, importantly reflecting large declines in energy prices.  Nonfarm payroll employment registered another large increase in April after a small decline in March; these data, along with the still-low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks, suggested that labor demand had remained robust thus far in 1998. Hiring in the trade, finance and real estate, and services industries was brisk in April; employment in construction retraced part of an apparently weather-related drop in March. The number of manufacturing jobs declined in April for a second consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate fell sharply, to 4.3 percent in April, after having averaged around 4-3/4 percent since last November.  Industrial production rose somewhat over March and April after weakening earlier in the year. Part of the slowdown this year, following rapid growth in the second half of last year, was attributable to weakness in utility output associated with unusually warm winter weather across much of the country. More importantly, though, manufacturing output had changed little on balance in recent months. In April, a pickup in the production of business equipment, particularly of information processing equipment, was largely offset by further declines in the output of construction supplies, basic metals, and nondurable materials. The production of consumer goods was unchanged. The factory operating rate eased further in April, reflecting the continuing brisk expansion in manufacturing facilities and slow growth in output.  Consumer spending had remained strong this year in the context of robust gains in income and household net worth and of very favorable consumer sentiment. Total retail sales rose appreciably in April, boosted by increases in purchases of automobiles and nondurable goods. Housing demand and residential construction activity also continued to increase at a rapid pace this year. Home sales were at very high levels, reflecting the continuing improvement in housing affordability as a result of declining mortgage rates. Although housing starts slipped in April, they remained at an elevated level.  Business fixed investment rebounded sharply in the first quarter from a small decline in the fourth quarter of 1997. A surge in expenditures on producers' durable equipment, notably on computers, communications equipment, and heavy trucks, more than offset continued weakness in outlays for nonresidential structures. While available indicators pointed to further substantial gains in equipment purchases over coming months, data on construction contracts offered little evidence of a pickup in nonresidential construction activity in the near term, even though vacancy rates were declining and office rents were rising.  Business inventories increased at a very rapid pace in the first quarter, but with sales strong, inventory-sales ratios remained within their ranges over the past year. In manufacturing, stock accumulation slowed in March after increasing fairly rapidly in January and February. At the wholesale level, inventories rose about in line with sales during the quarter, and in the retail sector inventories built up at a greatly accelerated pace in the first quarter.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter. The value of exports declined considerably in the January-February period, with most of the drop attributable to reduced sales to Asian countries. The decrease in exports was concentrated in agricultural products, industrial supplies, and machinery. The value of imports rose slightly, largely reflecting higher amounts of imported automotive products and higher service payments. The available information suggested that economic growth in continental Europe strengthened in the first quarter, with strong domestic demand apparently offsetting the effects of Asian turmoil on foreign trade. Robust domestic demand also continued to buoy the Canadian economy. By contrast, economic activity in Japan contracted in the first quarter and decelerated sharply further in Asian countries that had experienced financial turmoil.  Consumer prices were unchanged in March and rose moderately in April. Energy prices were down slightly further in April after declining markedly in previous months, and food prices increased a little; excluding food and energy, consumer price inflation picked up in April as prices of services accelerated and prices of tobacco surged higher. Over the course of recent months, core consumer inflation had accelerated to rates that were somewhat above those registered earlier. Even so, on a year-over-year basis, the increases in total and core consumer prices were substantially smaller over the twelve months ended in April than they were in the year-earlier period; falling import prices apparently helped damp the goods component of the index. At the producer level, price inflation of finished goods other than food and energy picked up a bit in April, but it was considerably lower over the twelve months ended in April than over the year-earlier interval. Inflation at earlier stages of production also remained subdued. The rate of increase in hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed in the first quarter, reflecting smaller advances in both the wage and benefit components of the index; however, compensation costs accelerated appreciably on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of faster growth in wages and salaries.  At its meeting on March 31, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging around 5-1/2 percent. However, in light of increased concerns that growth in aggregate demand might outpace the expansion of the economy's potential for some time, possibly generating inflationary imbalances in labor markets, the Committee decided that the directive should include a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  Open market operations throughout the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the intended average of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal funds rate. Though tax flows were heavy at times and reserves were drained from depository institutions as tax payments spilled into Treasury deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks, the federal funds rate averaged a little below its intended level over the period. Most other market interest rates declined slightly on balance over the intermeeting period; incoming data suggested that labor markets remained tight and that the economy retained considerable upward momentum, but market participants evidently gave greater weight to information indicating that wage and price inflation was well contained in the first quarter. Share prices in U.S. equity markets rose further despite some reports of soft corporate earnings, and equity prices in most other industrial countries also reached new highs.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of major currencies changed little on balance over the period. The dollar declined considerably against the German mark and other continental European countries amid signs of strong growth in the German economy and further progress in resolving the outstanding issues associated with next year's launch of the euro; French and German interest rates also rose slightly over the period. The dollar appreciated somewhat against the yen; the announcement of a large fiscal stimulus package and Japan's intervention in support of the yen did not offset indications of further weakening in the Japanese economy and related declines in Japanese interest rates. Other Asian financial markets came under renewed pressure after a brief period of relative calm. The currencies of several key Asian emerging market economies depreciated considerably against the dollar; and in sharp contrast to the performance of equity markets in most industrial countries, prices in Asian equity markets declined substantially on balance over the period to near their lows of late 1997 or early 1998.  M2 and M3 expanded briskly further in April, but data for late April and early May showed M2 declining and M3 leveling out; much of the fluctuation in M2 during the April-May period appeared to be related to movements of funds associated with unusually heavy nonwithheld tax payments and a surge in mortgage refinancings to take advantage of lower long-term rates. On balance, the underlying growth of these aggregates seemed to be slowing from the pace of the first quarter. The moderation in M3 partly reflected a reduced need for non-M2 sources of funds at a time when bank credit expansion seemed to be slowing. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently had slipped somewhat after picking up earlier in the year.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity would slow considerably during the next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and to add to the pressures on domestic producers to hold down prices to meet import competition. An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales. The staff analysis suggested that further strong gains in income, along with the surge in household net worth over the past several years, would support brisk, though gradually diminishing, gains in consumer spending. Housing demand, fostered by the favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, was expected to remain at a generally high level, though the anticipated slowing in income growth over the projection period would damp residential construction activity somewhat. Substantial increases in capital spending would continue, but slower growth in business sales and profits would produce a gradual deceleration. While pressures on production resources were likely to abate to a degree as output growth slowed, inflation was expected to increase somewhat from its recent pace in response to rising compensation costs associated with persisting tightness in labor markets, a limited rebound in energy prices, and a diminishing drag on non-oil import prices.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members noted the exceptional strength in domestic final demand and viewed robust further expansion in such demand as highly likely. Final purchases were being supported by accommodative financial conditions, especially a rising equity market, by ebullient consumer sentiment, and by business spending on productivity-enhancing equipment. While there were limited indications of weakness in some sectors of the economy--such as manufacturing, energy, and agriculture in some areas--the members did not see conclusive evidence of appreciable moderation in the pace of the overall economic expansion. Nonetheless, they generally believed that substantial moderation in the expansion was a likely prospect in coming quarters, largely as a consequence of a marked slowing in inventory investment from the clearly unsustainable pace of the first quarter and, to a lesser extent, from some further weakness in net exports. The outlook for the latter was especially uncertain, and the weakness could be greater than previously anticipated owing to renewed turmoil in emerging Asian economies and pronounced weakness in Japan. Whether the moderation in U.S. economic growth would be sufficient to forestall cost increases arising from tight labor markets that in turn would add to pressures on prices was open to question. To date, developments in business costs had been relatively benign, owing to an important extent to somewhat faster productivity growth. This circumstance and a number of one-time influences holding down costs and prices had contained inflation at rates that were lower than those seen in several decades, and probably would continue to do so for a while. But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.  In their assessment of the factors underlying the persisting strength of aggregate final demand, members took particular note of the effect of accommodative financial conditions. The rapid growth in consumer spending was being bolstered by large gains in stock market wealth; and the strength in housing and other interest-sensitive consumer expenditures also reflected declines in nominal, and perhaps in real, intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the ample availability of loans. Likewise, the ready availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms was a key factor in the continuing robust growth of business investment. Indeed, some members expressed concern that the widespread perceptions of reduced risk or complacency that had bolstered equity prices beyond levels that seemed justified by fundamentals were beginning to be felt in a variety of other markets as well, including commercial and residential properties, business ventures, and land. In the view of a number of members, rapid growth of the monetary aggregates, though it had slowed very recently, was a further indication that financial conditions were not restraining economic activity.  Despite the failure of domestic demand to moderate in line with their earlier expectations, the members were persuaded that appreciable slowing in the growth of economic activity was a likely prospect over the course of coming quarters even though its exact timing and extent were unknown. Key elements in this assessment were the outlook for inventories and net exports. The surge in inventory accumulation in the first quarter did not appear to have resulted in overall stock imbalances as evidenced by stock-sales ratios or anecdotal reports. Even so, growth in inventory investment at a pace sharply exceeding the sustainable growth of final sales was unlikely to continue for an extended period. Given the ample availability of industrial capacity and the related absence of pressures on lead or delivery times, business firms did not need to build precautionary stocks. Thus, inventory investment was likely to respond to the expected deceleration in final sales over coming quarters. Some members expressed reservations about the probable extent of the deceleration in the period ahead, especially in the context of their expectations of a still relatively robust uptrend in final sales.  Developments in Asia clearly were having adverse effects on a number of U.S. industries, but the overall effects on the U.S. economy appeared to have been limited thus far. Indeed, the direct effects of the Asian financial and economic problems on U.S. trade over time needed to be weighed against their indirect but positive effects in the near term in helping to hold down U.S. interest rates and in reducing the prices of oil and other imported commodities. However, members were concerned that, as evidenced by the most recent developments, conditions in Asian financial markets and economies were deteriorating further, with potentially adverse consequences for net U.S. exports. Of particular concern in this regard was the possibility of worsening economic conditions in Japan and the negative implications not only for U.S. trade with Japan but for worldwide trade and financial markets. Some members also commented that unsettled financial and economic conditions in East Asia could tend to exacerbate the economic problems of several important emerging economies in other parts of the world, including major Latin American trading partners of the United States. On balance, forecasts of a limited further drag on U.S. net exports from developments in Asia were subject to substantial uncertainty, with the risks tilted toward a greater effect on the U.S. economy than had been anticipated earlier. Moreover, the lingering effects of the dollar's appreciation last year against a broad array of currencies would continue to depress the nation's foreign trade position for some time.  The decline in the unemployment rate to its lowest level in nearly three decades underscored anecdotal reports of further tightening in labor markets in recent months and added to concerns about the outlook for inflation. Though the first-quarter data had not suggested as steep an increase as a number of observers had anticipated, labor compensation clearly was trending higher. But as suggested by the rise until recently in profit margins, businesses had been able to realize productivity gains that tended to offset the faster increases in compensation costs. Indeed, while the most recent data were difficult to read, once likely revisions were taken into account productivity improvements could well be on a steeper uptrend than had been estimated earlier. Even so, the members remained concerned that if pressures on labor resources continued to intensify, the associated increases in labor compensation would at some point significantly exceed the gains in productivity. The resulting pressures on prices might be muted, but probably only for a time, by the inability of many business firms in highly competitive markets to raise their prices or to raise them sufficiently to offset rising costs. Some members emphasized that a number of developments that had held down prices, including the dollar's sizable appreciation last year, the drop in world oil prices, and the downtrend in employee benefit cost increases were unlikely to be repeated over the coming year and could even be reversed to a degree. Members acknowledged, however, that the nexus between labor market tightness, accelerating labor costs, and the effects on price inflation was very difficult to ascertain and analyses based on earlier patterns that pointed to rising inflation had proved consistently wrong in recent years.  In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead, a majority of the members indicated that they preferred or could accept an unchanged policy. These members also expressed a preference for retaining the asymmetric instruction in the directive that the Committee had adopted at the previous meeting. In this view, the uncertainties in the outlook for economic expansion and inflation remained sufficiently great to warrant a continued wait-and-see policy stance. Considerations underlying this view included the possibility that financial and economic conditions in Asia might worsen further and exert a stronger retarding effect on the performance of the U.S. economy than presently seemed to be in train. A good deal of uncertainty also surrounded the potential extent to which developments in the domestic economy, notably the pace of inventory accumulation over coming months, might foster slower economic expansion and the related degree to which pressures in labor markets would be affected. Moreover, considerable questions remained about the relationship of labor market pressures to inflation. In these circumstances, it was possible that inflation would continue to be contained, though the risks clearly seemed to be tilted in the direction that action would become necessary at some point to keep inflation low.  While a delay in implementing a tighter policy that ultimately proved to be needed to curb rising inflation involved some risks, many of the members concurred in the view that the potential costs of postponing action for a limited time were small. By some measures, inflation had continued to drop in the first quarter, and the appreciation of the dollar, reduced commodity prices, and low--if not declining--inflation expectations would help to hold down nominal wage increases and price pressures for some time, even if, as a number of members suspected, the economy was now producing beyond its long- run potential. Forecasts of rising inflation had proved unreliable and needed to be viewed in light of the considerable uncertainties surrounding them. The members recognized, however, that the longer any needed action was delayed, the more important it would be to take prompt and perhaps vigorous action once the danger of rising inflation became clearer.  Another reason for not taking action at this meeting was the possibility that even a modest tightening action could have outsized effects on the already very sensitive financial markets in Asia. The resulting unsettlement could have substantial adverse repercussions on U.S. financial markets and, over time, on the U.S. economy. Many of the members emphasized, however, that market considerations could not be allowed to jeopardize the effective conduct of a U.S. monetary policy aimed at an optimal performance of the U.S. economy. Indeed, such a performance would best serve the interests of troubled financial markets and economies abroad.  A number of members indicated that the decision was a close call for them. In this regard, some emphasized that financial conditions were very accommodative in terms of the ample availability of financing to most borrowers on very attractive terms and increases in equity prices. Several expressed concern that the persistence of quite rapid monetary growth this year was symptomatic of a monetary policy that was not positioned to restrain ebullient domestic demand sufficiently, even if short-term real interest rates were quite high. Although some of these members could accept postponing action for the present to await further information on the balance of risks, two members, while acknowledging the uncertainties that surrounded the economic outlook, indicated a strong preference for tightening the stance of policy at this meeting. They believed that current policy was accommodating excessive strength in aggregate demand that very likely would be felt in higher inflation before long. Prompt tightening was needed to avert the necessity of stronger and potentially disruptive policy actions later to contain inflation.  All the members who intended to vote for an unchanged policy at this meeting supported the retention of a directive that was biased toward restraint. In their view, current developments did not call for any policy action, at least at this meeting, but because they felt the risks were tilted in the direction of rising inflation, a policy tightening move, possibly in the near future, was a likely though not an inevitable prospect.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two of the members supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that contained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has continued to grow rapidly in 1998. Nonfarm payroll employment registered another substantial increase in April after a slight decline in March, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in April. However, factory output has changed little on balance in recent months. Retail sales grew appreciably in April, and consumer spending as a whole has been very strong this year. Residential sales and construction also have strengthened this year. Business fixed investment rebounded sharply in the first quarter after having declined slightly in the fourth quarter, and available indicators point to continuing strength over coming months. Business inventories appear to have increased very rapidly in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation has remained subdued this year, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices.  Most market interest rates have declined slightly on balance over the intermeeting period. Share prices in U.S. equity markets have moved up a little further. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of major currencies has changed little on net over the period. However, the dollar has risen on balance against the currencies of key emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia. Equity markets in Asia have fallen substantially over the period to near their lows of late 1997, while those in Europe have risen to new highs.  M2 and M3 expanded briskly further in April, but data for late April and early May show M2 declining and M3 leveling out. The swing in these measures seemed to be related largely to movements of funds associated with tax payments. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat after a pickup earlier in the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic non- financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley, Meyer, Mses. Minehan, Phillips, and Rivlin.  Votes against this action: Messrs. Jordan and Poole.  Mr. Poole dissented because he believed that the sustained increase in money growth in recent quarters and associated accommodative conditions in the credit markets pointed to rising inflation. Although faster productivity growth suggested that trend output growth might be modestly higher than previously thought, the growth rate of aggregate demand over the past two years clearly had exceeded the economy's long-run growth potential. Without a reduction of aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise. In his view, the Federal Reserve should therefore take prompt action to reduce money growth to limit the rise in inflation and to avoid an increase in longer-term inflation expectations, which would tend to destabilize aggregate employment and financial markets.  Mr. Jordan also noted that the monetary and credit aggregates had accelerated further from already rapid growth rates in 1997. In his view, these high growth rates were fueling unsustainably rapid increases of real estate and other asset prices, and reports of ""too much cash chasing too few deals"" were becoming more frequent. Anticipated gains on both real and financial investments had risen relative to the cost of borrowed funds. In these circumstances, it was increasingly likely that the Committee would face a choice between smaller increases in interest rates sooner versus larger increases later. He added that maximum sustainable economic growth occurs when businesses and households act on the assumption that the dollar will maintain its value over time, and nothing he had heard from consumer groups, bankers, or other business people in his District led him to believe that decisions were being made in the expectation that the purchasing power of the dollar would be stable. Furthermore, expectations that market values of income-producing investments would continuously rise relative to underlying earning streams were not consistent with a stable purchasing power of money. He also believed that the view that real interest rates currently were high was not confirmed by observed behavior. Bankers told him that both consumers and businesses believed that credit was cheap and plentiful. These potentially inflationary conditions and imbalances in the economy were not conducive to sustained maximum growth.",199805,0,374,1998-05-31,0.16,0.17,0.09,-0.01,0.41,0.27,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1998-05-19

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity had slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter. Much of the slowdown reflected a substantial moderation in business inventory accumulation. Consumer spending, business investment, and residential homebuilding, though remaining robust, apparently also were decelerating somewhat after very strong gains in the first quarter; and the erosion in net exports continued to damp demand for domestically produced goods. Payroll employment persisted on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production seemed likely to record only modest further expansion in the second quarter. Labor markets remained tight, and there were indications of some further acceleration in employment costs. Recent data on consumer prices were a little less favorable than they had been earlier in the year.  Nonfarm payroll employment registered substantial increases in April and May despite further job losses in manufacturing. Construction payrolls declined in May, but they were up sharply on balance over the April-May period following substantial gains earlier in the year. Employment increases in service-producing industries, notably business services and retail and wholesale trade, continued to be robust. The civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.3 percent in May, and initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low through mid-June, after taking into account the onset of layoffs associated with the strike at General Motors.  Industrial production picked up in April and May after changing little in the first quarter, but the strike at General Motors likely depressed industrial production substantially in June. In manufacturing, the output of motor vehicles rose briskly on balance over April and May, and the production of computers and office equipment remained robust. Growth in the manufacture of materials slowed sharply, perhaps reflecting the effects of reduced exports to Asia. Output of utilities, which continued to fluctuate widely, changed little on balance over the April-May period. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity edged down in May to its lowest level in more than two years as capacity grew at a faster rate than output.  Total nominal retail sales posted large gains in April and May. Sales were strong at automotive dealers in response to a sharp increase in incentives offered by the Big Three automakers. Sales also rose briskly at building material and supply outlets and at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance stores. Although the growth in real outlays for services in April (latest data available) was held down by a small decline in purchases of energy services, the expansion of outlays for non-energy services remained brisk. Sales of homes were very strong in April and May, but housing starts and building permits declined slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis from their elevated first-quarter rates.  Available information suggested that the growth of business fixed investment slowed somewhat in the second quarter from a very strong pace earlier in the year. A deceleration in expenditures for producers' durable equipment, after the surge in purchases of computer and communications equipment in the first quarter, apparently more than offset a pickup in spending on nonresidential structures. The recent upturn in building activity was consistent with the continuing indications of declining vacancy rates and rising real estate prices, but available data on construction contracts did not point to further strength in nonresidential construction.  Business inventory investment slowed sharply in April from the extraordinarily rapid rate of accumulation in the first quarter. In manufacturing, stockbuilding picked up somewhat in April from the first-quarter pace, but with sales also rising, the stock-sales ratio remained at a very low level. Wholesale inventories declined sharply in April, primarily reflecting runoffs in stocks of motor vehicles; the inventory-sales ratio for the sector remained near the upper end of its range over the preceding twelve months. Retail inventory accumulation slowed somewhat in April, and the aggregate inventory- sales ratio stayed close to the lower end of its range over the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened further in April, as the value of exports declined more than that of imports. Exports of aircraft and parts dropped sharply from the first-quarter level, and exports of industrial supplies decreased by lesser amounts. Most of the decline in imports was in capital goods and automotive products. Recent information suggested a mixed economic performance among the major foreign industrial countries. Economic activity in Japan contracted sharply in the first quarter after declining slightly in the fourth quarter, and many other economies in Asia remained quite weak. The Asian crises held down exports of the major European countries, partly offsetting the influence of strong domestic demand.  Consumer prices advanced at a slightly faster rate in May as an upturn in energy prices and a large increase in food prices more than offset a slower rate of increase in the prices of nonfood, non- energy items. Core consumer prices accelerated during the three months ended in May, largely reflecting higher tobacco prices and shelter costs. Nonetheless, core consumer prices rose less over the twelve months ended in May than they had over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy continued to rise at a subdued rate in May. For the twelve months ended in May, core producer prices rose by a small amount after having changed little in the year-earlier period. At the intermediate level, core producer prices edged down in May and were little changed on net over the twelve months ended in May. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased at a slightly faster rate on balance over April and May. Measured on a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings accelerated further in the year ended in May. The largest gains were in business services and finance, insurance, and real estate, but marked acceleration also was evident in wholesale and retail trade. By contrast, gains in manufacturing had changed little over the past three years.  At its meeting on May 19, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to average around 5-1/2 percent. In light of concerns that growth in aggregate demand might remain so strong relative to the expansion of the economy's potential that inflationary pressures would tend to be generated, the Committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged close to the intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Market participants interpreted the further turmoil in financial markets in Asia and emerging market economies elsewhere as damping the outlook for U.S. economic growth and improving the chances that inflation would remain low. While most short-term interest rates changed little on balance over the period, yields on longer-term Treasury securities, and to a lesser extent on private debt instruments, declined somewhat, at least partly reflecting a further flight to safety and quality from renewed turbulence in a number of foreign markets. Share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile, and changes in major indexes were mixed on balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of other major currencies continued to increase through the middle of June, but it then retraced much of that rise, ending the intermeeting period somewhat higher on balance. The recent fluctuations in the dollar's trade-weighted value were largely accounted for by movements in the Japanese yen, which reached an eight-year low against the dollar in the middle of June in response to growing market pessimism about the prospects for a prompt resolution of Japan's financial sector problems and for economic recovery in that country. The yen rebounded in mid-June in response to coordinated intervention by the Japanese and U.S. governments but soon renewed its downward drift, partly as a result of rising concerns that the Japanese government would not take prompt action to address weaknesses in the country's banking sector and in aggregate demand; the yen finished the period substantially lower on balance. The dollar changed little on net against the German mark and other continental European currencies; declines in long-term interest rates in those countries generally matched the drop in yields on comparable U.S. instruments. Against the backdrop of the weakness in the yen, the currencies of key emerging market economies, particularly some of those in Asia, fell further against the dollar.  Growth of M2 and M3 slowed in the second quarter but remained fairly robust. Households accumulated unusually large deposit balances to make hefty nonwithheld tax payments in April, and these balances ran off in May as tax checks cleared; averaging through these gyrations, the expansion of the broad aggregates slowed on balance over April and May, and preliminary data suggest further slowing in June. The growth of M3 remained a little faster than that of M2, reflecting the further progress made by institution-only money market funds in attracting corporate cash-management business. For the year through June, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated somewhat after picking up earlier in the year; the moderation evidently reflected some slowing in the growth of business and household borrowing as well as paydowns of federal debt made possible by robust tax revenues.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would expand more slowly over the projection period than it had in recent years. Moderation in business inventory investment would damp domestic production as inventory accumulation was brought into better balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales. In addition, reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. The staff analysis suggested that the prospective gains in income coupled with the run-up that had occurred in household wealth would support further brisk, though gradually diminishing, increases in consumer spending. Housing demand was expected to remain at a generally high level in the context of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding somewhat. Growth in business fixed investment would gradually moderate from the vigorous pace of the first half of the year in response to smaller increases in business sales and profits. Pressures on labor resources were likely to diminish somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually as gains in compensation increasingly outpaced improvements in productivity.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members generally agreed that the expansion in economic activity was likely to be relatively moderate over coming quarters, and that such growth would be consistent with some limited increase in inflation from the current unusually low level. The accumulation of business inventories, which until recently had added substantially to economic growth, was expected to continue at a much lower and more sustainable pace. Moreover, the effects on the U.S. trade balance of the appreciated value of the dollar and of economic weakness in several of the nation's trading partners probably would hold down increases in domestic output in coming quarters. Many of the members commented, however, that the already substantial risks surrounding the economic outlook had increased on both sides of their forecasts. On the downside, the greater risks focused on potential developments in Asia. Financial and economic conditions in Asia had deteriorated in recent months, and the members could not rule out the possible emergence of even greater financial turmoil and economic weakness in that part of the world that could spill over to other countries including the United States. On the upside, in the absence of strongly retarding effects from developments in Asia, persistent strength in domestic final demand might well add to inflationary pressures. Indeed, there were signs of modestly rising inflation in some recent measures of prices, though the rate of inflation was still relatively subdued.  In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1998 and 1999. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1998 as a whole had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent, which implied some moderation over the second half from staff estimates at the time of this meeting of the average rate of growth in the first and second quarters; for 1999 the forecasts pointed to moderate growth and were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. These projected rates of economic growth were accompanied by a very slight rise in the civilian rate of unemployment over the next 18 months to still quite low rates centering on 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 1998 and 4-1/4 to 5 percent for 1999. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, indicated a slightly faster rise over the second half of this year and in 1999, largely because of expectations that the plunge in energy prices earlier in the year would not be repeated. Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 1-3/4 to 2 percent for 1998 as a whole and 2 to 2-1/2 per cent in 1999.  In their review of developments in different parts of the country, Reserve Bank presidents reported high levels of business activity across the nation, but several also indicated that there were signs of some slowing in the expansion of regional economic activity. With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices. However, some anecdotal and other evidence suggested that retail sales had moderated in recent weeks in at least some areas; the moderation appeared to be only partly associated with the work stoppage at General Motors. The apparent deceleration in retail sales could prove to be temporary, though some slowing in the growth of overall consumer spending over the forecast horizon, perhaps to a pace more in line with the growth of disposable income, was viewed as a reasonable expectation, especially with equity price gains of recent years unlikely to be repeated.  Business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend, buoyed by several favorable factors. The latter included the ready availability of debt and equity financing on relatively attractive terms, and opportunities to invest in high-tech equipment at lower prices to enhance productivity and hold down labor costs in a period of very tight labor markets. While these factors were expected to continue to support appreciable further expansion in business investment, growth in demand for capital goods was likely to diminish as a result of the projected slowing in the expansion of final sales and business profits and the absence of pressure on manufacturing capacity. With regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction, members reported that declining vacancy rates and rising prices and rents of office buildings and to some extent other commercial structures were fostering very high levels of construction activity in several areas. Moreover, there were indications that some construction projects were being delayed because of scarcities of labor or construction materials. A number of members commented that some of the construction was being undertaken on a speculative basis and that the strong pace of building activity pointed to overbuilding in some areas. On the residential side, construction activity also displayed considerable strength across much of the country. There were widespread anecdotal and other reports of high levels of home sales and few reports of faltering housing demand. Favorable factors undergirding current housing activity, including the robust growth in employment and incomes, high wealth-to-income ratios, and very attractive terms on home mortgages, seemed likely to continue to hold housing construction close to current elevated levels.  Based on very partial data, business inventory investment appeared to have moderated considerably in the second quarter from an unsustainable pace in the first quarter, and some further reductions in inventory accumulation could be expected over the balance of the year. Several members commented, however, that despite the outsized rate of stockbuilding early in the year, there were no broad indications of an inventory overhang, whether from the standpoint of inventory-sales ratios or anecdotal expressions of concern. Against this background, many of the members saw little reason to anticipate a further sizable drop in nonfarm inventory investment, though the performance of this sector of the economy was always subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  With regard to the external sector of the economy, the recent deterioration of conditions in Japan and several emerging economies in Asia and the related effects on other countries around the world were adding significantly to the uncertainties facing the U.S. economy. Members commented that it was too soon to judge the eventual extent and duration of the turmoil in Asia and its spillover to other nations, but several suggested that the consequences were likely to be more severe and longer lasting than they had anticipated earlier. Moreover, there seemed to be a very small but growing possibility of marked and spreading weakness that might have a more major effect on U.S. financial markets and the U.S. economy. One key to an improvement in the outlook for Asia was the adoption of appropriate policies by Japan, but very difficult political as well as economic problems clearly were involved for that nation and their resolution might well require an extended period of internal deliberations. From the standpoint of the United States, the Asian crisis and its repercussions around the world obviously were deepening the nation's trade deficit, but other effects such as those on U.S. interest rates and prices in world commodity markets, notably oil, were boosting domestic demand and tended to have a moderating near-term influence on inflation.  With regard to the outlook for prices and wages, members observed that some key measures of price inflation had displayed a modest uptilt recently. Though overall price inflation had remained subdued when viewed over a longer horizon, signs of a continuing acceleration, should they become evident, would be a matter of growing concern. Reflecting very tight labor markets, the rate of increase in labor compensation had been on an uptrend, but the rise in unit labor costs and overall unit product costs had been held down to a very modest pace by gains in productivity. At some point, however, the advance in labor compensation would exceed likely improvements in productivity by an increasing margin unless the expansion in overall demand, and hence in labor demand, moderated significantly. Members cited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened worker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in part by ample job opportunities. Any tendency for faster increases in labor costs to feed through to price inflation was likely to be reinforced for a time by the unwinding of a number of special factors that had tended to hold inflation down, including the decline in energy prices in recent quarters and the dollar's appreciation during 1997. Moreover, a rise in inflation would tend to erode currently favorable inflation expectations and lead workers to demand higher nominal compensation. Nonetheless, questions could be raised about how rapidly and to what extent the effects of tight labor markets would show through to higher labor compensation and overall producer costs and in turn how quickly the latter would induce significantly faster increases in prices. Very competitive domestic and international markets for a wide range of products along with reduced prices of oil, other commodities, and imports more generally could well keep inflation in check for some time. It was noted in this regard that members had tended in recent years to anticipate greater inflation than had materialized.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one of the members indicated that they could support an unchanged policy stance and retention of the current tilt toward possible tightening in the directive. Although recent developments had increased both the upside and the downside uncertainties in the economic outlook, most of the members felt that the risks continued to point on balance toward rising inflation. While the available evidence suggested that the economic expansion had in fact slowed considerably in the second quarter, largely because of reduced inventory accumulation against the backdrop of weakness in the foreign trade sector, the retarding effects of those factors were seen as likely to wane over coming quarters and there were only limited indications of any softening in domestic final demand. Moreover, the persistence of accommodative financial conditions, as evidenced by the ample availability of financing on favorable terms to business and household borrowers and by robust monetary growth, might well continue to support relatively strong domestic spending. As a consequence, many of the members expressed concern that the expansion in demand might continue at a fast enough pace to raise pressures on wages and prices over time. Nonetheless, the substantial uncertainties relating to prospective developments argued, as they had at recent meetings, in favor of a cautious ""wait and see"" policy stance.  Another important reason for deferring any policy action was that a tightening move would involve the risk of outsized reactions and consequent destabilizing effects on financial markets in the growing number of countries abroad that were experiencing severe financial difficulties. It was not possible to anticipate precisely what those effects might be, but the risks seemed to be particularly high at this time. To be sure, U.S. monetary policy had to be set ultimately on the basis of the needs of the U.S. economy, but recognition had to be given to the feedback of developments abroad on the domestic economy. Those repercussions could be quite severe in the event of further sizable economic and financial disturbances in some of the nation's important trading partners. Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad. A number of these members emphasized, however, that they continued to see a high probability that some tightening of monetary policy would be needed later to curb rising inflationary pressures. Accordingly, they believed that the Committee should take advantage of any early opportunity to tighten policy in order to improve the prospects of containing inflation and prolonging the economic expansion. One member was persuaded, however, that such a policy move should be implemented at this meeting in order to avert the need for a stronger and probably more disruptive policy adjustment that would be needed later to head off rising inflation.  Given that the balance of risks was seen as pointing to rising inflation over time, the members agreed that it was desirable to retain the tilt toward restraint in the directive. Such a tilt would continue to underscore the Committee's commitment to its long-run objective of price stability and its view of the likely direction of the next policy move.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members accepted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that contained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment registered another substantial increase in May, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.3 percent. Industrial output picked up in recent months after weakening early this year; however, a strike at General Motors likely depressed output substantially in June. Although retail sales posted large gains in April and May, overall consumer spending appears to have grown less rapidly in the second quarter than in the first. Residential sales have remained exceptionally strong, but housing starts and building permits slipped back in the spring, on a seasonally adjusted basis, from a sharply increased first-quarter level. Available indicators suggest that growth of business fixed investment also is slowing after a surge earlier in the year. Business inventory accumulation appears to have moderated in April from an extraordinarily rapid rate in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services continued to widen in April. Developments in the food and energy sectors contributed to a slightly faster advance in consumer prices in May.  Most short-term interest rates have changed little since the meeting on May 19, but longer-term rates have declined somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile and changes in major indexes were mixed on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar rose sharply through mid-June in terms of other major currencies, declined more recently, but is up somewhat on net since the May meeting; the fluctuations in the average value of the dollar in terms of these major currencies were largely related to movements against the Japanese yen. The dollar has risen further against the currencies of key emerging market economies, particularly some of those in Asia.  Growth of M2 and M3 slowed in the second quarter, but remained fairly robust. For the year through June, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat after a pickup earlier in the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley, Meyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin.  Votes against this action: Mr. Jordan.  Mr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the unsustainably rapid growth of domestic demand--fueled by the acceleration of money and credit growth in the past year--was reflected in the recent sharp increase in imports and rising trade deficits. As U.S. output growth slows significantly from the rapid pace of 1997 and early 1998, it will be essential that domestic demand also slow. The very welcome progress toward eliminating inflation in recent years has contributed to the outstanding performance of the economy. Allowing domestic demand to continue to exceed domestic production would run the risk that corrosive effects of rising inflation would undermine future growth prospects. Furthermore, the resultant trade and current account deficits would have to be matched by ever larger inflows of foreign capital. Modest monetary restraint at this time might prevent either the buildup of inflationary imbalances that would eventually necessitate future policy restraint or unsustainable capital flows. In either case an economic contraction might become unavoidable.",199807,0,376,1998-07-31,-0.37,-0.22,0.03,-0.13,-0.69,-0.31,-0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1998-07-01

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that domestic final demand continued to expand at a robust pace. However, increases in consumer spending and business investment seemed to be moderating somewhat after very large gains earlier in the year, and inventory investment had slowed markedly. Net exports remained weak as a result of the persisting turmoil in Asian economies. The strike at General Motors had damped overall economic activity temporarily, but total payroll employment continued to trend upward, and labor markets remained extremely tight. Despite the pressures on labor resources, trends in wages and prices had remained stable in recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in July even though manufacturing payrolls plunged in association with the General Motors strike; job growth remained strong in most non-manufacturing sectors. Construction employment continued to increase at about the brisk pace recorded over the first half of the year, and hiring in retail trade surged. The expansion of jobs in the services industry slowed considerably in July, but this partly reflected a decline in temporary help jobs related to the GM strike. The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in July at 4.5 percent.  Industrial production declined considerably in June and July. Abstracting from the effects of the GM strike, manufacturing output fell slightly over the June-July period after having recorded moderate gains on average in earlier months of the year; production of business equipment expanded briskly in June and July, while the output of consumer goods and materials weakened. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity was down appreciably in June and July, mostly reflecting the effects of the GM strike.  Total nominal retail sales fell in July after having risen at a rapid pace in the first half of the year. A sharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles, reflecting the termination at midyear of sales incentives offered by the Big Three automakers and shrinking inventories at GM dealers, more than accounted for the drop in July. Non-auto-related outlays continued on a robust upward trend, with gains evident in all major categories. Sales increases were particularly large at furniture and appliance stores and apparel outlets. In the housing sector, both demand and construction activity remained strong. Starts of single-family units edged down in May but rebounded in June. Sales of new homes were at an all-time high in June, and sales of existing homes were only a little below the record level reached in March of this year. With sales robust, the inventory of unsold new homes remained low.  Growth of business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter as the pace of business spending for durable equipment moderated considerably from the exceptionally strong rate of earlier in the year. Nonetheless, outlays for computer and communications equipment continued to expand rapidly in the second quarter, and purchases of other capital goods rose briskly. Available information suggested that growth in business spending on capital goods likely would slow further in the months ahead. In contrast to the strength in equipment spending, expenditures on nonresidential building declined further in the second quarter, and available indicators pointed to a mixed outlook for this sector in coming months.  Business inventory investment slowed sharply in the second quarter, owing in substantial measure to a runoff of motor vehicle inventories at the wholesale and retail levels. In manufacturing, stockbuilding slowed somewhat in the second quarter, and the stock- shipments ratio at the end of the quarter remained close to the low level that had prevailed over the past year. Wholesale inventories changed little on balance in the second quarter as a sizable decline in motor vehicle stocks offset a buildup of non-auto durable goods; in June, the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector was at the upper end of its narrow range for the past year. At the retail level, a drop in inventories of motor vehicles in the second quarter more than offset a small increase in stocks at non-auto retailers, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio in June was a little below the lower end of its range for the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in the second quarter; the value of exports of goods and services declined for a second straight quarter, while the value of imports continued to rise, though at a somewhat reduced pace. Much of the decline in exports in the second quarter was in capital goods, but there also were noticeable decreases in most other major trade categories. The increase in imports was concentrated in imported consumer goods, aircraft, and steel. Economic activity in most of the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand, though at a slower rate, in the second quarter. In Japan, however, economic activity appeared to have contracted sharply further in the second quarter. In most other Asian economies, currencies and equity prices were under downward pressure, and in Russia, asset values plummeted in often disorderly markets. Risk spreads on dollar-denominated debt widened substantially, not only in Russia but for Latin American issuers as well.  Price and wage inflation had remained relatively stable in recent months. Both the overall CPI and the CPI excluding food and energy items rose slightly on balance in June and July; a small rise in food prices offset a noticeable decline in energy prices over the two-month period. For the twelve months ended in July, the core CPI registered a slightly smaller increase than it had in the year-earlier period, partly reflecting lower prices for new motor vehicles. Producer prices of finished goods changed little on balance in June and July; a sizable drop in the prices of energy products over the June-July period more than offset a modest rise in core producer prices. For the year ended in July, core producer prices rose somewhat more than in the year-earlier period, reflecting larger increases in the prices of finished consumer goods. Hourly compensation of private industry workers rose in the second quarter at about the average rate for the previous two quarters. For the year ended in June, however, hourly compensation picked up significantly from the year-earlier period; the acceleration in compensation was evident in wages and salaries and in benefits.  At its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to average around 5-1/2 percent. With the balance of risks still pointing to the possibility of rising inflation over time, the Committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  Open market operations were directed throughout the period since the meeting on June 30-July 1 toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged a little above the intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other interest rates fell slightly on balance over the intermeeting period in response to market assessments that worsening conditions in Asia, Latin America, and Russia portended slower growth in U.S. output and inflation over an extended period ahead. Declines in Treasury yields also reflected a continuing flight toward safety and quality from the persisting turbulence in foreign markets. In an atmosphere of increasing concerns about the prospects for corporate earnings, share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile and major indexes declined appreciably on balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar rose somewhat further over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies. The dollar changed little against the continental European currencies but it moved up strongly against the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar. The dollar's rise in terms of the yen reflected spreading pessimism regarding the Japanese government's ability to redress the problems of its troubled banking system and provide fiscal stimulus adequate to turn its economy around. The dollar's advance against the Canadian dollar occurred in the context of continuing weakness in global commodity prices that was weighing down that currency. The dollar also appreciated slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of the developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important trading partners of the United States.  After having expanded briskly in the second quarter, M2 grew at a somewhat more moderate rate in July, and M3 changed little. The deceleration in M2 reflected reduced inflows to retail money market funds. The halt in the growth of M3 was associated with a sharp runoff of large time deposits and outflows from institution-only money market funds triggered by a temporary spike in interest rates on market instruments around quarter-end. For the year through July, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated somewhat in recent months after a pickup earlier in the year.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would expand through 1999 at a pace somewhat below the estimated growth of the economy's potential. Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Moreover, additional moderation in business inventory investment would damp domestic production as inventory accumulation was brought into better balance with the forecast of a more moderate trajectory of final sales. The staff analysis suggested that the prospective gains in income coupled with the earlier run-up in household wealth would support further brisk, though gradually diminishing, gains in consumer spending. Housing demand was expected to remain relatively strong in the context of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding somewhat. Growth in business fixed investment would gradually moderate from the vigorous pace of the first half of the year in response to smaller increases in business sales and profits. Pressures on labor resources were likely to diminish somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was expected to pick up gradually as a result of an anticipated reversal of some of the decline in energy prices this year.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on the disparate forces that continued to shape trends in economic activity, notably the persistence of considerable strength in private domestic spending and the damping influences stemming from foreign economic developments. The latter seemed likely to be larger than previously anticipated as financial turmoil in some foreign economies had deepened and spread and currently showed few signs of stabilizing. Moreover, equity prices and risk spreads in U.S. financial markets were beginning to be adversely affected, potentially slowing domestic demand. The members generally anticipated somewhat more moderate growth than they had in their previous forecasts, with prospective expansion at a pace near or somewhat below the growth of economy's potential. Nonetheless, they remained concerned about the potential for higher inflation, given the widespread tightness in labor markets and an upward tilt in the rise of labor compensation. For the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases.  Among the factors bearing on the outlook for domestic economic activity, the members viewed the external sector as a major source of uncertainty. The continued rapid decline in net exports during the first half of the year largely seemed to reflect the further financial unsettlement and a deeper contraction in Asian economies than had been anticipated earlier, and several members commented that they saw little evidence that financial and economic conditions in Asia were stabilizing. Indeed, such conditions appeared to be worsening further in some Asian nations, and other countries had been affected by the associated weakening in the demand for commodities and the more risk-averse attitudes of investors. Anecdotal reports at this meeting suggested that the impact on the domestic economy was being felt by manufacturing firms in several industries, although some firms also reported that declining exports to Asia were being offset at least in part by rising exports to other areas of the world. Looking ahead, the members agreed that the duration and extent of disruptions in Asian and other economies could not be anticipated with any degree of confidence; while net exports were not expected to decline as rapidly as they had in the first half of the year, even more serious disruptions in Asia could not be ruled out and would have important implications for the U.S. economy.  In their review of developments in key expenditure sectors of the domestic economy, members observed that over the first half of the year the strength in domestic final demand, notably in the consumer and business investment sectors, had more than offset the negative effects of developments in the foreign sector and other factors. In the consumer sector, the outlook for further sizable increases in spending was buttressed by unusually favorable underlying factors, including solid ongoing gains in employment and incomes and substantial further increases in household net worth this year. A pause in the robust gains in retail sales in early summer was accounted for in part by limited inventories of new motor vehicles associated with the now-settled GM strike. While a variety of factors pointed to sustained growth in consumer spending, a less ebullient stock market, should it persist, would foster more moderate expansion in consumer spending, perhaps at a pace more in line with the rise in consumer incomes, or at an even slower pace if consumer confidence were adversely affected by developments in financial markets.  Business fixed investment also seemed to be on a solid upward trajectory, though some slowing in the growth of business investment spending was anticipated in response to a projected deceleration in overall business output and weaker business profits. Members continued to cite anecdotal evidence of very strong construction activity in many parts of the country, including indications that building projects were being delayed because of shortages of labor and some construction materials. In other parts of the country, building activity remained at a high level but seemed to have moderated somewhat. Business spending for various types of high-tech equipment had surged to an undoubtedly unsustainable pace in the first half of the year. Against this background, several members referred to emerging signs of slightly more cautious attitudes among their business contacts, in many cases the result of concerns about developments in Asia. On balance, diminishing momentum in business investment appeared to be a likely prospect, but the ample availability of financing on favorable terms would continue to support this sector.  In the housing sector, construction activity remained at a high level in most parts of the nation and, as was the case for construction activity more generally, homebuilding continued to be restrained in a number of areas by limits on the availability of labor and other inputs. The housing market clearly was benefiting from strong gains in household incomes, high levels of household wealth, and very attractive financing costs. There were few indications of any moderation in this sector of the economy. Even so, some slowing was anticipated, at least after current construction backlogs were satisfied, in response to the projected slowing in employment growth and the high level of the housing stock.  Currently available data indicated that the pace of inventory accumulation had moderated substantially in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the rate of non-auto inventory investment in the spring still appeared to have exceeded a pace that was consistent with sustainable growth in sales. Anecdotal reports at this meeting pointed to a somewhat mixed picture with regard to desired inventory levels, including examples of both overstocking and shortages. Looking ahead and apart from short-run fluctuations, inventories were not expected to add to demand over coming quarters, at least after the restocking of motor vehicles by General Motors was completed.  In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for wages and prices, members commented that the rate of inflation in consumer prices was difficult to characterize with precision because alternative price indexes provided different measurement results; in particular, chain price indexes for consumption expenditures showed substantially less inflation than the CPI. Even so, it was clear on the basis of any measure that consumer prices and inflation more generally had remained remarkably subdued in the context of very tight labor markets and upward pressure on labor compensation. And whatever the explanation, it seemed that the economy had been less prone to rising inflation than it had been historically under similarly tight labor market conditions. The members acknowledged that a number of special factors were contributing to the relatively benign inflation climate. Those factors included the appreciation of the dollar; declines in many commodity prices, notably that of oil; ample industrial capacity; and evidently diminished inflation expectations. Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins. Against this backdrop, members remained persuaded that a significant rise in price inflation was not likely to occur in the nearer term.  Looking further ahead, however, the members generally agreed that rising price inflation remained an important threat. Significant additional tightening in labor markets would, of course, exacerbate that risk, but even at current levels these markets were tight and at some point labor costs could increase more rapidly, pressing on prices. Moreover, the effects of some of the factors holding down inflation seemed likely to wane, and possibly to reverse, over time. The latter included the effects of the dollar's appreciation on the prices of imports and competing domestic products, a possible upturn in energy prices and perhaps other commodity prices as foreign economies stabilized, and faster increases in the costs of worker benefits, notably those related to health care. The apparently greater willingness of labor unions to press for higher wages and other benefits in very tight labor markets might also intensify upward pressures on labor costs. On balance, while the risks of an overheat- ing economy and rising price inflation might have faded to some degree, many of the members continued to emphasize that the Committee could not ignore those risks in its policy formulation.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one of the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining a steady policy stance. The overall performance of the economy remained highly satisfactory. While inflation risks were still a concern, given the high level of output and strong domestic demand, the uncertainties bearing on the economic outlook remained substantial, and indeed the risks on the downside seemed to have increased appreciably further. On balance, domestic economic and financial conditions had not changed sufficiently during the inter- meeting period to warrant an adjustment to policy. With regard to the current uncertainties in the economic outlook, members emphasized that the extent and ultimate effects of the apparently spreading fragility in foreign financial markets and economies on U.S. financial and economic conditions were unknown. In these circumstances, nearly all the members believed that a cautious wait-and-see approach to policy seemed appropriate to allow the Committee time to assess the course of events and the interplay of the divergent forces bearing on the performance of the economy. In this regard it was noted that while domestic financial conditions remained generally accommodative, recent developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets had tended on balance to decrease some of the stimulative effects of financial conditions on aggregate demand in the United States by shifting demand overseas, increasing somewhat the cost of raising capital, and reducing the financial wealth of households. However, a few members expressed concern about the potentially inflationary implications of relatively rapid growth in key monetary aggregates over the past year, though such growth appeared to have moderated recently. And in the view of one of these members, the trend in monetary growth along with indications of rising speculative imbalances and excesses in various markets for financial and nonfinancial assets called for a prompt firming of monetary policy.  While overall economic conditions had not changed enough in recent weeks to warrant an adjustment in policy, a majority of the members agreed that the risks to the economic outlook were now more balanced and called for a shift from asymmetry to symmetry in the Committee's directive. Such a directive would better represent their view that the Committee's next policy move could be in either direction depending on developments abroad and their interaction with a domestic economy that had remained quite strong. Greater difficulties abroad and associated downward pressures on demand and prices had substantially diminished the chances of a strengthening of inflation pressures over coming months and quarters that would require a near-term tightening of policy. Other members continued to believe that the risks were still tilted to some degree toward rising inflation, though to a lesser extent than earlier. Labor market developments continued to suggest that the economy could well be producing beyond its sustainable potential and concrete signs that inflation pressures would abate had yet to emerge. Accordingly, they still preferred an asymmetrical directive but could accept symmetry in light of the prevailing uncertainties in the economic outlook and the expectation, shared by the other members, that policy would not need to be changed during the intermeeting period ahead.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members were in favor of retaining a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. Most also indicated that they could support a shift to a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that domestic final demand has continued to expand at a robust pace, but overall economic activity has been adversely affected by the strike at General Motors and developments in Asia. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand through July and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent. Industrial production declined considerably in June and July; most of the drop over the two months reflected the GM strike. A decline in total retail sales in July was more than accounted for by a sharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles. Residential sales and construction have remained exceptionally strong in recent months. Available indicators point to continued growth in business capital spending, although apparently at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year. Business inventory accumulation slowed sharply in the spring. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in the second quarter. Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months.  Most interest rates have fallen slightly on balance since the meeting on June 30-July 1. Share prices in U.S. equity markets have remained volatile and major indexes have declined appreciably on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar rose somewhat further over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies; in addition, it was up slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of the developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important trading partners of the United States.  After robust growth in the second quarter, M2 decelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July. For the year through July, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat in recent months after a pickup earlier in the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting on June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter- meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley, Meyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin.  Vote against this action: Mr. Jordan.  Mr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the underlying strength of aggregate demand in the U.S. economy would remain fundamentally intact, despite economic problems abroad. The problems in Asia provide a channel for economic imbalances to develop. Exports from some U.S. manufacturing industries will decline due to softer foreign markets and import competition. At the same time, domestic demand for imports, housing, and consumer durables will increase due to favorable interest rate trends. Though U.S. production of goods and services might slow during the period ahead, it is not yet clear that total demand will diminish at a comparable pace. At the same time, ample credit provision encourages speculative lending and excessive consumption. Consequently, continued rapid growth in the money supply creates the risk that inflation will accelerate and economic imbalances will become protracted.",199808,0,377,1998-08-31,1.01,0.27,0.06,0.21,1.55,0.07,-0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1998-08-18

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate. Growth of private domestic final demand had slowed from its pace in the first half of the year, though it was still relatively robust, and reduced spending on U.S. exports and rising import competition were exerting appreciable restraint on overall activity, as was a slowing in inventory investment. Reflecting the moderation in growth from the first half of the year, total payroll employment was trending up at a somewhat slower pace. Despite the pressures on labor resources associated with still-tight labor markets, trends in wages and prices remained stable.  Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed somewhat over the July-August period. The deceleration reflected further job losses in the manufacturing sector, notably in the apparel and electronic components industries on which the crisis in Asia was having a sizable adverse effect. Outside of manufacturing, employment increases remained strong in the service-producing industries, and even though anecdotal reports continued to indicate shortages of skilled workers, further sizable job gains were recorded in construction. The civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.5 percent in August.  Industrial output rebounded in August as production at General Motors resumed following the settlement of the labor strike. Outside the motor vehicle sector, however, output had changed little on balance over recent months in association with the erosion in net exports stemming from the turmoil in Asia and its repercussions on a number of other U.S. trading partners; production of consumer goods edged down on balance in July and August, and the growth of output of business equipment slowed. The rise in industrial production in August boosted the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity, but the factory operating rate remained somewhat below the level of late last year.  Total retail sales were held down in July and August by a sharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles, but non-auto sales continued to rise at a brisk pace. The gains were widespread, with increases in spending on furniture and appliances, apparel, and miscellaneous nondurables especially strong. Purchases of services also were up appreciably further in July and August after a rapid second-quarter rise. Sales and construction of residential buildings remained quite strong on balance, reflecting very favorable homebuying conditions. Housing starts slipped in August but were still above the high level of the first half of the year. Sales of existing homes dropped back in August from the record high registered in July, while sales of new homes were slightly higher in July (latest data) than in the first half of the year.  Available indicators pointed to more moderate growth in business fixed investment after the surge in capital spending during the first half of the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods declined in July and August, retracing much of June's large increase, while sales of medium and heavy trucks continued to increase at a rapid pace. Nonresidential construction weakened in July, extending a pattern of sluggish building activity; construction of industrial structures remained in a downtrend, and office building activity changed little on balance over June and July.  Business inventory accumulation eased further in July after having slowed sharply in the second quarter, and inventory-sales ratios remained moderate. Stockbuilding in manufacturing was at a somewhat lower rate in July than in the second quarter, and the stock-shipments ratio for the sector stayed a little above the low level that had prevailed over the past year. At the wholesale level, a further decline in inventories reflected additional reductions in motor vehicles; the inventory-shipments ratio remained in the upper part of its narrow range for the past year. In the retail sector, a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships more than offset a rise in stocks of other goods. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the retail sector was at a relatively low level.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in July from its second-quarter average, with the value of imports falling more than the value of exports. Much of the decline in imports and exports involved trade in automotive products with Canada and Mexico. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries other than Japan decelerated on average in the second quarter, with a deterioration in net exports partially offsetting continued strength in domestic final demand. In Japan, activity contracted for a third consecutive quarter; net exports made a large positive contribution as imports dropped sharply, but domestic demand, most notably business fixed investment, fell steeply.  Both the overall and the core CPI again rose moderately in August; a further increase in food prices was offset by a sizable decrease in energy prices. For the twelve months ended in August, core consumer prices rose slightly more than they had in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods dropped appreciably in August, largely reflecting declines in the prices of finished foods and, notably, energy goods. Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy moved slightly higher in the twelve months ended in August after having edged down in the year- earlier period. Producer prices at earlier stages of production were under strong downward pressure; prices of intermediate materials fell during the year ended in August by slightly more than they had risen in the year-earlier period, and prices of crude materials plunged further in the twelve months ended in August. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers continued to increase at a relatively moderate pace in the July-August period, and for the twelve months ended in August, they rose slightly more than in the year-earlier period.  At its meeting on August 18, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to average around 5-1/2 percent. However, in light of mounting financial strains abroad, their potential implications for the U.S. economy, and less accommodative conditions in domestic financial markets, the Committee concluded that the risks to the outlook were no longer tilted toward rising inflation but had become more balanced. Accordingly, the Committee adopted a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate remained close to its intended level of 5-1/2 percent. In an atmosphere of greatly increased volatility in financial asset values worldwide and a reduced appetite for risk among many investors, interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities, and to a much smaller extent on investment-grade corporate debt, fell appreciably during the intermeeting period; in contrast, yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms increased sharply, and a number of large banks tightened terms and standards for making business loans to sizable firms. Credit conditions also tightened in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Share prices in U.S. and foreign equity markets remained volatile during the intermeeting period, and major U.S. equity price indexes declined considerably further on balance.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar depreciated substantially over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies. A spreading perception that the United States was more vulnerable than either Europe or Japan to an economic downturn in Latin America, increasing expectations of monetary easing in the United States, and shifts into yen associated with the end of the fiscal half-year in Japan and the unwinding of some investment positions financed in yen were factors that weighed on the dollar. By contrast, the dollar appreciated slightly in terms of an index of currencies that includes the developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important trading partners of the United States.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up considerably in August and apparently strengthened further in September. The acceleration was the result of unusually large inflows to money market funds that in part reflected households' preference for relatively safe, liquid placements for funds shifted out of equities and lower-rated corporate debt. For the year through September, both aggregates recorded growth rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt had moderated somewhat in recent months after picking up earlier in the year.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting incorporated a considerably weaker assessment of underlying aggregate demand, owing to downward revisions to growth abroad and to the less accommodative conditions that were evolving in U.S. financial markets. The staff projected that the expansion of economic activity would slow for a time to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential and then would pick up to a rate more in line with that potential. Damped expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place considerable restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for a period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Domestic production also would be held back for a while by the efforts of firms to bring inventories into better balance with the anticipated moderation in the trajectory of final sales. In addition, private final demand would be restrained by tighter lending terms and conditions as well as the drop that had occurred in equity prices. Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on developments that pointed to the potential for a significant weakening in the growth of spending. They recognized that there were at present few statistical indications that the economy was on a significantly slower growth track. Indeed, the available data suggested that consumer expenditures and business investment retained considerable strength. At the same time, however, investors' perceptions of risks and their aversion to taking on more risk had increased markedly in financial markets around the world. That change in sentiment was exacerbating financial and economic problems in a number of important trading partners of the United States. In addition, it was generating lower equity prices and tightening credit availability in U.S. financial markets. As a consequence, the downside risks to the domestic expansion appeared to have risen substantially in recent weeks. Though labor markets were expected to remain relatively tight for some time, the members saw little prospect that inflation would gather significant momentum in coming quarters. Declining commodity and other import prices would be restraining prices and inflation expectations for a while. Overall consumer prices might rise a little more rapidly next year as the effects of a number of favorable factors, such as falling energy prices, diminished or reversed, but underlying inflation was expected to stay quite subdued as inflation expectations remained damped and pressures in labor markets became less pronounced.  The intensification and further spread of turmoil in international financial markets, notably since the outbreak of a financial crisis in Russia in mid-August, had spilled over into U.S. financial markets. Strong demands for safety and liquidity had driven down yields on U.S. Treasury securities, but spreads of private rates over Treasury rates had gapped higher. Increases in risk spreads were especially large for lower-grade borrowers and on bonds below investment grade, whose rates had increased considerably since mid-August. In addition, many banks had tightened their credit standards and terms. Prices in U.S. equity markets, which had weakened appreciably before the crisis in Russia, had declined substantially further. These market developments strongly suggested, and anecdotal reports tended to confirm, the emergence of widespread perceptions of greater risks in a broad range of financial investment activities and of considerably greater reluctance to put capital at risk. The members did not believe that the tightness in credit markets and strong demand for safety and liquidity were likely to lead to a ""credit crunch,"" though some members expressed the view that such an outcome could not be ruled out. At a time when business balance sheets already indicated a significant softening of cash flows owing to weaker profits, many business firms were experiencing increased difficulty and costs in their efforts to raise funds in debt or equity markets or to borrow from lending institutions; if these conditions were to persist, the sustainability of the current strength in business capital expenditures would come into question. The decline in stock market prices also appeared likely to damp the growth of consumer spending over time, with added implications for business capital expenditures.  Despite the emergence of decidedly less hospitable financial conditions, there were few indications in the data available to the Committee of any weakening as yet in consumer and business spending. Consumer expenditures, though temporarily held back by shortages of new motor vehicles stemming from the work stoppage at General Motors, had remained on a solid uptrend, with overall growth in recent months apparently slipping only a little from a remarkably rapid pace in the first half of the year. Strong growth in jobs and incomes along with substantial further increases in stock market prices through mid-July had fostered a high level of consumer confidence and spending. Members commented that the more recent weakness in the stock market and the related decline in household net worth had removed an important support for the growth of consumer spending, but they noted that recent surveys indicated only a slight deterioration in consumer sentiment and that the stimulus from earlier stock market gains probably would dissipate only gradually. Looking further ahead, consumer spending could be expected to expand at a pace that was more in line with the growth of household incomes than it had been in recent years.  Growth in business investment spending, while apparently moderating from an extraordinary pace during the first half of the year, likewise seemed to have been little affected to date by the tightening in credit conditions and the increased aversion to risktaking. Data on shipments of capital equipment continued to display a clear uptrend and members reported very strong construction activity in many parts of the country. Declining relative prices and rapid technological advances were likely to generate appreciable further growth in spending for computer and office equipment over the projection horizon. Moreover, new orders for capital equipment did not suggest any general weakening, though such orders had declined dramatically in the steel industry under the weight of intense foreign competition. Even so, the members anticipated that the pronounced increase in investor and lender perceptions of risk would result in considerable moderation in the growth of overall business investment, especially in light of concurrent expectations of reduced gains in sales and profits and evidence of some diminution in both internal and external sources of financing. Reports from nearly every Federal Reserve District suggested that executives had become considerably more concerned about business prospects. In a number of cases they already had seen a substantial downturn in their exports or a surge in competing imports at prices they found difficult to match. In other cases they were anticipating such developments or were reacting to the general sense of unease and uncertainty evident in financial markets. Forthcoming data on capital spending including new orders and contracts were likely to point to a weaker uptrend in business fixed investment. How much weaker was a major uncertainty in the economic outlook and a key to determining the extent to which financial market turmoil was likely to affect the real economy.  Very favorable underlying factors, including a strong job market and declining mortgage rates, had helped to sustain homebuilding activity at an elevated level. The large further advance in stock market prices earlier in the year also appeared to have been a positive factor in the strong performance of the housing market. While anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only a few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices and forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some moderation in housing activity at some point. Even so, the continued affordability of new homes for many households was likely to sustain housing demand at a relatively high albeit diminished level, and homebuilding activity would be bolstered for a time as backlogs created by shortages of skilled construction workers in many areas were worked off.  Net exports, while subject to a great deal of uncertainty, were seen as likely to continue to restrain demand and production to a substantial extent over coming quarters. Members cited examples from across the country of business firms, notably in the manufacturing sector but also in energy, agriculture, forest products, and some other industries, that already were being adversely affected by weaker export markets and increased competition from lower-priced imports. Moreover, the intensification of turmoil in international financial markets since the Russian devaluation and debt moratorium had led to tighter financial conditions in key U.S. trading partners--especially in the Americas--a development that was likely to weaken growth in those markets and demand for U.S. products. Of potentially greater importance for the domestic economic outlook, however, was the spread of international financial unsettlement to U.S. financial markets and the attendant deterioration in business and investor confidence. It was clear that the contagious effects of international economic and financial turmoil had markedly increased the downside threat to the domestic expansion.  In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members referred to the persistence of very tight labor markets across the nation and to indications of escalating increases in labor compensation in a number of areas. At the same time, price inflation generally had remained subdued, with little evidence of acceleration. As had been true for an extended period, competitive pressures were widely reported to be preventing employers from passing through rising labor costs to consumer prices. Looking ahead, members cited a variety of factors bearing on the prospects for inflation that on the whole suggested that the risks of an inflationary uptrend had receded. Favorable factors in the outlook for prices included the lingering effects of the dollar's earlier appreciation, ample industrial capacity, generally declining commodity and other import prices, and an apparently more rapid trend of productivity gains. Over time, some slowing in economic growth and less intense pressures on labor resources would hold down increases in labor costs. Developments that might tend to offset these positive factors, at least in part, included a possible turnaround in energy prices after sizable declines over the past year and an upturn in the costs of worker benefits, notably for medical expenses. A few members also observed that the rapid growth of key monetary aggregates, including M2, over a period of several quarters was a worrisome element in the outlook for inflation, though the most recent surge in M2 probably was induced in large measure by a flight to quality and liquidity.  In their discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal calling for a slight easing in reserve markets to produce a decline of 1/4 percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of about 5-1/4 percent. In their view, such an action was desirable to cushion the likely adverse consequences on future domestic economic activity of the global financial turmoil that had weakened foreign economies and of the tighter conditions in financial markets in the United States that had resulted in part from that turmoil. At a time of abnormally high volatility and very substantial uncertainty, it was impossible to predict how financial conditions in the United States would evolve. In the view of many members, equity prices and risk spreads in U.S. financial markets previously had embodied an overly optimistic assessment of business prospects and they saw some correction in these markets as a positive development. Moreover, they expected markets to become much more settled once the initial adjustments to new risk assessments had been made. On balance, however, credit conditions were likely to remain tighter and equity prices lower than earlier, and in the context of continued damped inflation, monetary policy had the room to adjust to these new circumstances. In any event, an easing policy action at this point could provide added insurance against the risk of a further worsening in financial conditions and a related curtailment in the availability of credit to many borrowers.  The members agreed that the decrease in the federal funds rate should be limited to 25 basis points. Several emphasized in this regard that although the risk of rising inflation might have receded, it was still present, especially in light of the persistence to date of very tight labor markets and relatively robust economic growth. In these circumstances, while an easing move was warranted to provide some insurance against undesirably tight domestic financial conditions, many members saw the need for a cautious policy action. A more sizable policy move at this point might convey an exaggerated impression of the Committee's current thinking regarding the extent of downside risks in the economy.  The members were divided over whether to retain the current symmetrical directive or to adopt an asymmetrical directive that would be tilted toward ease. A small majority favored moving to asymmetry on the grounds that it seemed more consistent with the increased downside risks to the economy that they believed would exist even after the contemplated policy action and that it would underscore the Committee's readiness to respond promptly to conditions that might threaten the sustainability of the expansion. Other members expressed a preference for a symmetric directive but indicated that they could accept a directive that was tilted toward ease. In their opinion, the uncertainties relating to the direction of the next policy move were sufficiently great on both sides to justify a neutral directive. Some commented that unanticipated developments were likely in any event to provide the principal basis for future policy actions. They suggested that the Committee would undoubtedly confer by telephone should such developments materialize during the intermeeting period, and the symmetry or asymmetry of the directive would have little bearing on whatever policy decision might be reached.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members supported a directive that called for conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with a slight decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of about 5-1/4 percent. All the members also indicated that they could accept a change in the directive to include a bias toward easing. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has been growing at a moderate rate, paced by brisk, albeit slowing, increases in spending by businesses and households, while expansion in overall economic activity has continued to be restrained by developments abroad. Nonfarm payroll employment grew somewhat more slowly over July and August, mostly reflecting job losses in the manufacturing sector; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent in August. Industrial production has changed little on balance over recent months. Total retail sales over July and August were held down by a sharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles. Residential sales and construction have remained quite strong in recent months. Available indicators point to continued growth in business capital spending, but at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year. Business inventory accumulation slowed further in July. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in July from its second-quarter average. Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months.  Most interest rates have fallen appreciably since the meeting on August 18, though yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms have increased and a number of large banks have tightened terms and standards for making business loans. Broadly similar developments have occurred in major foreign markets. Share prices in U.S. and global equity markets have remained volatile and major indexes have declined considerably further on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar declined substantially over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies; it was up slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of the developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important trading partners of the United States.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in August and appeared to have picked up further in September, partly reflecting shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt. For the year through September, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt has moderated somewhat in recent months after a pickup earlier in the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting on June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with decreasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate might or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Committee decisions to amend the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and to renew certain swap line agreements also are summarized below.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested some moderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace during the summer months. Although growth of economic activity in the third quarter apparently about matched the pace in the first half of the year, a large buildup of nonfarm inventories had accounted for a significant portion of the persisting strength of the expansion during the quarter. Growth in consumer spending had been well maintained during the summer months, and housing activity had remained at a high level. In other major sectors of the economy, business fixed investment had softened after having surged in the first half, and net exports had declined further, although at a reduced pace. Growth in employment had slowed appreciably on balance during the summer and early fall months, but tight conditions had persisted in most labor markets. Recent wage and price developments had been mixed.  Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in September and October. The slowing partly reflected sizable job losses in manufacturing, which has been substantially affected since earlier in the year by increasing foreign competition stemming from the crisis in Asia. Outside of manufacturing, increases in employment in the service-producing industries moderated somewhat over the two months, although gains in finance, insurance, and real estate were relatively robust. The civilian unemployment rate remained near 4-1/2 percent during the two months.  Industrial output had declined slightly in recent months after having rebounded in August when production resumed at General Motors following settlement of the labor strike. Outside the motor vehicle sector, manufacturing output edged lower in recent months after having decelerated markedly earlier in the year. Weakness in the manufacturing and mining sectors was associated in large measure with the fallout from the turmoil in Asia, its repercussions on a number of U.S. trading partners, and the related softness in world oil markets. The downward trend in the utilization of capacity in manufacturing left the factory operating rate appreciably below its level of late last year.  Personal consumption expenditures rose considerably further during the third quarter, though at a much slower pace than that recorded earlier in the year. Retail sales were down slightly on balance during the quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in sales of motor vehicles associated with the work stoppage at General Motors. However, the settlement of that strike and the resumption of production led to an upturn in overall motor vehicle sales in August and a sizable advance in September. A large further gain in such sales contributed to a sharp rise in overall retail sales in October. Consumer confidence retreated further in October, but according to a major survey it turned up in early November, albeit to a level still somewhat below its peak earlier in the year.  Available indicators pointed to a pickup in business capital spending after a third quarter lull, owing to some extent to a recovery from the General Motors strike. Business investment expenditures during the summer were held down in part by the strike- related decline in fleet sales of new motor vehicles. In addition, spending for other types of business equipment grew somewhat more slowly in the third quarter after having expanded at an extraordinary pace earlier in the year. Orders received by U.S. equipment makers continued to trend up through September. In contrast, nonresidential building activity apparently fell somewhat further in the third quarter. While the construction of lodging facilities surged and the construction of office space persisted at a high level, there was a decline in other commercial building, which includes retail stores and warehouses, industrial structures, and institutional buildings. The availability of financing for various types of construction appeared to lessen substantially in late summer, and financing costs rose for many borrowers.  In the residential sector, housing sales and starts remained quite strong, though below early summer highs. Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions. Multifamily housing starts increased considerably in the third quarter, but since late summer the availability of financing for multifamily building projects has tended to diminish and interest costs to rise.  Business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stocks-sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some industries that were being adversely affected by the nation's growing trade deficit. In manufacturing, however, stockbuilding slowed during the summer months and the stock-shipment ratio was unchanged at a level just above its average for the past year. At the wholesale level, a rapid increase during the third quarter lifted the inventory- sales ratio for this sector to its highest level since 1986; nearly half the rise was the result of a buildup of farm products that was related in part to an early harvest, but wholesalers of machinery, chemicals, and metals and minerals also apparently experienced undesired buildups of stocks. Retail inventories excluding motor vehicles accumulated at a slow pace during the summer, and the inventory-sales ratio for this category remained well within the narrow range of the past year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened to some extent in July-August from its second-quarter average. The value of imports in the July-August period, though rising appreciably in August, was somewhat below the second-quarter average, with most of the decline involving automotive products and oil. The value of exports fell somewhat over the two months, largely reflecting declines in exports of automotive products and industrial supplies and reduced service transactions. Decreases in exports partly reflected weakness in foreign economies. In the third quarter, growth in economic activity slowed on average in the major industrial countries, other than Japan, from the average pace in the first half of the year and contracted for a fourth consecutive quarter in Japan. There were widespread indications in the industrial nations, particularly from surveys of business and consumer confidence, that some slowing was persisting into the fourth quarter. Elsewhere, the available evidence pointed to some improvement in economic trends in a number of Asian nations, but the economies of several sizable South American countries appeared to have weakened. Recent economic indicators for Mexico were mixed.  The performance of various measures of wages and prices was uneven in recent months. The most recently available employment cost index indicated that hourly compensation of private industry workers posted a sizable increase in the third quarter. However, gains in average hourly earnings moderated considerably in September and October. The increase in the employment cost index over the past year was appreciably larger than in the previous year while the advance in average hourly earnings moderated somewhat.  Consumer energy prices rose appreciably in October, but they were still down sharply from a year earlier and on balance limited the increase of overall consumer prices over the past year. Core consumer prices moved up at a faster pace than overall consumer prices in recent months and over the past year, reflecting sizable increases in the prices of tobacco, used cars and trucks, and services. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged up in recent months but were down on balance over the past year; excluding food and energy items, producer prices rose somewhat over the past year.  At its meeting on September 29, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with a one-quarter percentage point decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent. The Committee also decided to adopt an asymmetric directive that was tilted toward ease to highlight its view that the risks to the economic expansion were mainly on the downside and to underscore its readiness to respond promptly to developments that threatened the sustainability of the expansion. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over subsequent months.  Following the meeting, open market operations were directed initially toward implementing a slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate, responding to quarter-end pressures and uncertainties created by shifting funding patterns in volatile financial markets, tended at first to average somewhat above the intended rate of 5-1/4 percent despite a relatively liberal provision of reserves by the System. Strains in financial markets continued to mount, with intermediaries and final investors much more cautious about risks and leverage and much more eager to hold very liquid assets. These developments in turn disrupted flows of funds in a number of financial markets. On October 15, the Committee discussed these developments and their implications for the domestic economy, and the members supported the Chairman's suggestion that, in keeping with the directive issued at the September 29 meeting, he instruct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to reduce the intended federal funds rate by a further 25 basis points to around 5 percent. On the same day, the Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 5 percent to 4-3/4 percent. These actions were taken in the light of growing indications of caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally that were deemed likely to restrain aggregate demand in the future. Subsequently, trading in the federal funds market remained relatively volatile but the federal funds rate averaged close to its lower intended level. In financial markets more generally, strains gradually moderated after mid-October and sizable issuance of securities resumed in a number of key markets, but uncertainty remained high and relatively illiquid conditions persisted. In the stock market, share prices dropped in the weeks following the September meeting, but the market rallied strongly after mid-October and key market indexes posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar fell moderately over the period in relation to other major currencies. The largest decline occurred in relation to the Japanese yen and appeared to reflect efforts to reduce speculative exposure to that currency; changes in the value of the dollar against other major currencies were mixed, likely fostered by disparate interest rate and economic developments. The dollar also fell somewhat in terms of a broad index of currencies of other countries that are important trading partners of the United States, including the developing nations of Latin America and Asia.  M2 and M3 posted very large increases in September and October. The gains appeared to be induced to an important extent by increased demand for safe and liquid assets in a period of substantial turmoil in financial markets that led to shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt. The advance in M2 during October probably also was boosted by the decline in its opportunity cost resulting from the effects of the System's easing actions on market interest rates and the unusual softness in Treasury bill rates during much of the month. The even faster increase in M3 in October also reflected both inflows to institution- only money market mutual funds that were stimulated by declines in short-term market rates and bank efforts to fund heavy demand for loans arising in part from the deflection of demand for funding from securities markets. For the year through October, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt moderated slightly in recent months after picking up earlier in the year.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to point to considerable slowing in the expansion of economic activity to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential, but the expansion was expected to pick up later to a rate more in line with that potential. Subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place considerable, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Domestic production also would be held back for a time by the efforts of firms to bring inventories into better balance with the anticipated moderation in the trajectory of final sales. In addition, private final demand would be restrained a bit by the tighter terms and conditions that were now imposed by many types of lenders and by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier increases in equity prices. Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise considerably over the year ahead in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members observed that indications of some moderation in the pace of the economic expansion were still quite limited, but they generally agreed that the economy appeared to be headed toward slower growth. Relatively tight profit margins and less ebullient growth in wealth were among the factors expected to be damping investment and consumption. In addition, even apart from the possibility of further financial contagion in Latin America, the weakness in foreign economies continued to be seen as a persistent source of restraint on demand in a number of domestic sectors, notably manufacturing, agriculture, and some extractive businesses. Although the financial markets had improved substantially in recent weeks, overall credit conditions were still relatively unsettled and a possible reintensification of difficulties in credit markets constituted an important downside risk to the expansion. The members recognized that not all the risks were in one direction, however. The economy had demonstrated remarkable resilience and strength over recent years, and in the view of some members the rapid growth of liquidity and bank credit suggested that financial conditions were not excessively tight. With regard to the outlook for inflation, members noted that while statistical and anecdotal information pointed to persistently tight labor markets in much of the nation, price inflation remained subdued. Indeed, even though the recent evidence relating to prices was somewhat mixed, several broad measures of prices suggested that inflation might be on a declining trend.  In the course of the Committee's discussion, the members gave considerable attention to recent financial developments and their implications for the economic outlook. Financial markets clearly had calmed markedly since the System's easing actions in mid-October, though they were still atypically volatile. Risk spreads had narrowed substantially and other measures of financial market performance also suggested that risk aversion and the related desire for liquidity had diminished appreciably. Markets for new issues had reopened for many borrowers, and stock market prices had posted large gains. Nonetheless, strains and weaknesses in financial markets had not disappeared--many risk spreads were still at unusually high levels-- and the markets remained quite sensitive to unanticipated developments. Members also noted that the improvement in debt markets appeared to have come to a halt most recently and indeed that renewed strains had emerged in some short-term debt markets, though the latter probably were related in large measure to concerns about year-end pressures in the money markets. Indeed, efforts by lenders and borrowers to position for year-end financial statements were likely to contribute considerably to keeping market conditions unsettled over coming weeks. Lending activity at banks had increased sharply in recent months as many borrowers found other sources of funds less receptive or unavailable and turned to backup lines for credit, but banks also had tightened their credit terms and standards for most new loans and lines of credit. As a result, financing generally had become less available and more expensive for higher-risk business borrowers. In light of these developments, members believed that the continuing fragility of financial markets and the increased scrutiny of the credit quality of borrowers, though the latter was in some respects a welcome development, posed a considerable downside risk to the expansion. The very recent behavior of equity prices was difficult to explain satisfactorily, and potential movements in those prices posed risks on both sides of the most likely forecast: A future substantial increase would bolster wealth and spending, but a sharp decline also could not be ruled out--especially if, as seemed quite possible, added increases in prices were not supported by robust increases in profits.  Foreign economic and financial developments were another important source of downside risk and uncertainty. The economic and financial turmoil in Asia had spread to numerous other nations around the world and to an extent to the United States. While economic weakness in many U.S. trading partners likely would continue to have adverse effects on net U.S. exports, the potential extent of such weakness was subject to considerable uncertainty as were the associated repercussions on financial markets. As they had at previous meetings, members referred to numerous anecdotal reports of heightened competition from foreign producers that was curbing the sales of many domestic manufacturers, notably in the steel industry, and in some other industries and agriculture. Moreover, the low level of world oil prices, which appeared to be importantly associated with diminished demand from Asian countries, was retarding production and reducing revenues in the U.S. energy and related industries. On the positive side, members commented that economic and financial conditions appeared to have stabilized or improved a bit in a number of Asian nations, though the recession in Japan showed little evidence of coming to an end, and the outlook for Brazil seemed a little more promising. However, economic and financial conditions in Brazil and a number of other countries remained very fragile. The recent depreciation of the dollar, while perhaps putting some upward pressure on prices, would damp the deterioration in net U.S. exports.  In their review of recent and prospective developments across the nation and in key sectors of the economy, members referred to scattered indications of some slowing in private domestic final demands. In the important consumer sector, however, evidence of weakening growth in expenditures was quite limited. The most recent anecdotal reports pointed to solid growth in most though not all regions of the country, and retail sales posted a strong advance in October. Moreover, consumer sentiment remained at a high level, albeit below its peak earlier in the year according to a recent survey. Members commented, however, that the more moderate growth in employment and incomes experienced recently likely would persist and should result in reduced gains in consumer expenditures next year, but they also noted that the extent of the deceleration was subject to considerable uncertainty. Some members referred to reports from contacts in the retailing industry who expressed some concern about the potential for weaker retail sales after the holiday season. A significant factor bearing on consumer spending would be the performance of the stock market. The impetus from the wealth effects of rapidly rising share prices would wane if such prices were to stabilize near current levels.  With regard to business fixed investment, anecdotal evidence was accumulating that many business firms, notably in manufacturing, were scaling back their planned capital outlays for the year ahead. Factors contributing to the prospective deceleration in business capital expenditures included a weaker trend in profits over the past several quarters, a related deterioration in business cash flows, and a large buildup in capacity over the course of recent years. Members also referred to indications of curtailed availability and more costly financing for some businesses, notably for relatively speculative construction projects. A number of members observed that the latter was a healthy development in that it would tend to hold down overbuilding in some areas. Overall, capital expenditures would undoubtedly recover from their slight decline during the summer months, but the outlook was for growth next year at a pace well below that experienced for an extended period before mid-1998. Housing construction was expected to remain at a high level, buttressed by attractive terms on new home mortgages, but housing activity appeared to have peaked or declined slightly in some regions.  The rapid buildup in inventories during the third quarter was not likely to continue, but the timing and extent of the expected moderation were largely unpredictable. It was noted in this regard that while inventories appeared to have risen to uncomfortable levels in some industries, there was no evidence of a general inventory overhang. Looking ahead, the projected slowing in the growth of final sales, including the effects of weak export markets, likely would reinforce business efforts to bring the growth of their inventories into better alignment with that of their sales, and such a development should contribute to the projected slowing in overall economic activity in coming quarters. It was unclear at this point to what extent year 2000 concerns might stimulate extra inventory investment prior to the end of 1999.  In their review of developments bearing on the outlook for inflation, members commented that labor markets remained exceptionally tight, though there was little evidence that they had tightened further in recent weeks. Employers were continuing to resist pressures to grant unusually large wage increases, and the persistence of vigorous competition, including that from Asian imports, was preventing most business firms from passing cost increases through to prices. Indeed, the declining trend in profits in recent quarters suggested that many firms were absorbing some of their rising labor costs to the extent that the latter were not offset by improvements in productivity. Looking ahead, slower growth in economic activity would tend to hold down pressures on wages and prices during 1999 and imports from Asian and other depressed economies would continue to generate intense competition in many markets; but labor markets remained tight, energy and commodity prices could well turn up after substantial declines, and the recent depreciation of the dollar would lessen pressures from foreign competition. A number of members expected that, on balance, inflation might be less favorable next year, though any deterioration in underlying trends should be relatively limited; others anticipated little change in and possibly some further ebbing of price inflation, extending the subdued behavior of a number of comprehensive measures of prices.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they could accept a proposal to reduce the federal funds rate by a further 25 basis points to an average of 4-3/4 percent. This policy decision was viewed as a close call by several members. While the growth of the economy was expected to slow appreciably over the year ahead, the expansion currently displayed only modest signs of moderating from what seemed to be an unsustainable pace. Moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later. The members were more concerned, however, about the risks stemming from the still sensitive state of financial markets, and in that regard many believed that a prompt policy easing would help to ensure against a resurgence of severe financial strains. A further easing move would complete the policy adjustment to the changed economic and financial climate that had emerged since midsummer and would provide some insurance against any unexpectedly severe weakening of the expansion. Most members saw little risk that a modest easing would ignite inflationary pressures in the economy, given the subdued behavior of inflation and their outlook for economic activity. Moreover, the easing could readily be reversed if unexpected circumstances should call for such an action. In this view, the risks of inaction were greater in terms of the potential financial consequences and also could materialize much sooner than the risks of stimulating greater inflation through the slight easing that was contemplated.  Some members indicated that in light of continued robust economic growth, tight labor markets, and improving financial conditions they had a preference for awaiting further developments that might provide a stronger basis for an easing action. Some of these members expressed concern that easier reserve conditions would accommodate a step-up in monetary growth that was already quite rapid, with potentially inflationary consequences later. Nonetheless, all but one of these members could endorse the decision to ease, given the evident downside risks in the international situation, financial market uncertainty, the likelihood that inflation would still be quite low, and the possibility of reversing the action reasonably promptly should circumstances warrant.  Given its decision to ease policy, the Committee favored a change to symmetry from the asymmetry toward ease in its recent directives. A symmetrical directive was now felt to be appropriate in light of the Committee's expectation that further easing was not likely to be needed over the months ahead unless ongoing developments pointed to a more substantial decline in the growth of economic activity or further ebbing of inflation than was currently anticipated. The members recognized that the possible emergence of severe year-end pressures in the money market might require some temporary easing in reserve conditions, but such a development did not seem to have a high probability and could in any event be readily and properly accommodated regardless of the bias in the directive.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all except one member supported a directive that called for conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with a slight decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of about 4-3/4 percent. These members also accepted a proposal to remove the bias toward easing that had been adopted at the previous meeting. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the the intermeeting period. A staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested that the reserve conditions contemplated by the Committee were likely to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some moderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace during the summer months. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in September and October; the civilian unemployment rate remained near 4-1/2 percent. Industrial production has declined slightly in recent months. Business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stock- sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some sectors strongly affected by the nation's trade deficit. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in July-August from its second-quarter average. Total retail sales rose sharply in October after increasing only moderately in August and September. Residential sales and building starts have remained quite strong, but below recent peaks. Available indicators point to a pickup in business capital spending after a lull in the third quarter, owing in part to a recovery from the summer strike in the motor vehicle industry. Trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months.  Most market interest rates have risen on balance since the meeting on September 29, though yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms have declined. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 5 to 4-3/4 percent on October 15. Share prices in U.S. and global equity markets have remained volatile but have posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar declined moderately over the period in relation to other major currencies; it also fell somewhat in terms of an index of the currencies of other countries that are important trading partners of the United States.  M2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent months, reflecting the effects of recent System easing actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt. For the year through October, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt has moderated slightly in recent months after a pickup earlier in the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting on June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with decreasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter- meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley, Meyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin.  Votes against this action: Mr. Jordan.  Mr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the two recent reductions in the Federal funds rate were sufficient responses to the stresses in financial markets that had emerged suddenly in late August. An additional rate reduction risked fueling an unsustainably strong growth rate of domestic demand. He expressed concern that the excessively rapid rates of growth of the monetary and credit aggregates were inconsistent with continued low inflation. Moreover, any further monetary expansion in response to economic weakness abroad could ultimately have a disrupting influence on domestic prosperity if policy were forced to reverse course at a later date to defend the purchasing power of the dollar.",199811,0,380,1998-11-30,-0.14,0.15,0.09,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1998-11-17

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy had continued to expand at a brisk pace in recent months. Domestic final demand had remained robust, and production and employment had recorded further solid gains. Trends in various measures of wages and prices had been mixed in recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose strongly in November after recording reduced increases in September and October. Job gains were widespread in November; hiring in the services industries remained brisk, construction payrolls surged further, and retail employment rebounded after a lackluster rise in October. In sharp contrast to the general job picture, employment in manufacturing continued to drop. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in November.  Total industrial production declined somewhat in November in association with a weather-related drop in utilities output and persisting weakness in mining activity. Manufacturing output was unchanged in November after a considerable increase in October. Production in high-tech industries recorded large gains over the October-November period, the output of construction supplies climbed rapidly, and consumer goods manufacture expanded briskly. Elsewhere, production of motor vehicles and parts was unchanged on balance over the two months and materials output continued to decline, with the iron and steel industry registering particularly large decreases. The utilization of manufacturing capacity dropped over the October- November period to its lowest level in more than five years.  Strength in consumer spending persisted in October and November, with retail sales rising sharply in both months. Increases in sales of motor vehicles and other durable goods were particularly large, but expenditures for nondurable goods also recorded sizable advances. Supported by continuing gains in disposable income and the rebound in the stock market, consumer confidence remained at a relatively favorable level, though noticeably below the peak reached earlier in the year.  The residential housing sector continued to surge, as single- family housing starts registered another strong advance in November and sales of new homes remained at a very high level. Unseasonably favorable weather over much of the country evidently contributed to that performance. Nonetheless, the low level of mortgage rates and a record high in an index of consumer assessments of homebuying conditions in November suggested that strength in single-family housing might continue for a time. Multifamily housing starts in October and November were slightly above the average for earlier in the year, and permits for new projects had been rising recently.  Business fixed investment appeared to have rebounded from a small decrease in the third quarter that had been associated in part with a strike-related drop in business purchases of motor vehicles and persisting weakness in nonresidential construction. Shipments of office and computing equipment rose sharply in October after having declined for two months, and a sizable backlog of orders for communications equipment suggested that the downturn in shipments in October after a September surge would be shortlived. In addition, outlays for heavy trucks reached record levels and expenditures for aircraft were well maintained. In the nonresidential sector, building activity remained soft in October. Office construction picked up further in response to falling vacancy rates and rising rental costs, but other building activity continued sluggish, and available data on new contracts pointed to persisting weakness.  Business inventory accumulation slowed appreciably in October after a sizable rise in the third quarter. In manufacturing, however, the pace of stockbuilding picked up in October from a slow rate in the third quarter, and the stock-shipments ratio remained in the upper portion of its narrow range over the past year. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined somewhat in October following a large increase in the third quarter; much of the reduction was in farm products. The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector was still at the top of its range over the past year. Retail inventory accumulation in October was near the modest pace of the third quarter, and the inventory-sales ratio was slightly below its range over the preceding twelve months.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in October was little changed from its September level but was slightly smaller than its average for the third quarter. The value of exports was up considerably in October from its third-quarter average; the largest gains were in machinery, agricultural products, and industrial supplies. The value of imports also rose in October. The rise in imports was spread across all major trade categories, with the largest increases being in capital goods and oil. The limited information available for the fourth quarter suggested that the Japanese economy remained mired in recession and that the pace of economic growth in most of the other major industrial countries was slowing. Activity in most of the Asian developing economies remained depressed, though there were signs that activity in some was nearing a trough and that growth in China and Taiwan had picked up somewhat. In contrast, economic conditions in most Latin American economies had worsened considerably in recent months.  Consumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in October. For the twelve months ended in November, the increase in core consumer prices was a little higher than in the previous twelve-month period, reflecting slightly bigger advances in the prices of both commodities and services. A similar pattern was evident in producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy; core producer prices continued to rise at a low rate in November, and the increase in these prices in the twelve months ended in November was somewhat larger than in the previous twelve-month period. In contrast, prices for crude and intermediate materials continued their downward trend in both the October-November period and the twelve months ended in November. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers had slowed over recent months to a modest rate in October and November. While the deceleration in hourly earnings was relatively widespread across industries, and most pronounced in manufacturing, wages continued to accelerate in the services industries and in finance, insurance, and real estate.  At its meeting on November 17, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with a one-quarter percentage point decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. The Committee also decided that moving to a symmetric directive would be appropriate, given that further easing likely would not be needed over the months ahead unless unexpected developments were to point toward a more substantial weakening in the growth of economic activity or to less inflation than was currently anticipated. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.  Open market operations immediately after the meeting were directed toward implementing the desired slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, and through the remainder of the intermeeting period the Manager sought to maintain that easier stance. The federal funds rate remained very close to its intended lower level on average, and most other short-term market rates registered small mixed changes. Longer-term Treasury rates declined somewhat in response to a weaker outlook for foreign economic activity and the potential damping effect of lower commodity prices on inflation. Share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile but posted substantial increases on balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar fell slightly over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies and also in terms of an index of the currencies of other countries that are important trading partners of the United States. Concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. markets to financial difficulties in Brazil and uncertainty generated by the impeachment proceedings were said to weigh on the dollar at times. The dollar's larger decline against the Japanese yen than against the German mark and other European currencies may have stemmed from a disparity in interest rate movements in those countries; long-term interest rates rose in Japan, partly in anticipation of heightened financing requirements associated with further fiscal stimulus, while European interest rates fell in response to cuts in official interest rates and weaker-than-expected economic data. Financial conditions affecting emerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the Committee eased monetary policy at its November 17 meeting, but that trend was subsequently reversed after Brazil's legislature decided to reject a key fiscal reform measure.  M2 and M3 had continued to expand rapidly in recent months, although incoming data indicated that growth was slowing somewhat in December. The continued strength of M2 in November reflected the reduction in its opportunity cost as a result of recent easings of monetary policy, greater growth of liquid deposits in association with heavy mortgage refinancing activity, and brisk demand for U.S. currency both at home and abroad. M3 growth was bolstered by further large flows into institution-only money market funds and additional RP financing in association with hefty acquisitions of securities by banks. For the year through November, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded in recent months at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range. Continued paydowns of debt by the federal government were more than offset by appreciable growth of private demands for credit to finance strong spending on durable goods, housing, and business investment, as well as merger and acquisition activity.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting pointed to considerable slowing in the expansion of economic activity in the year ahead to a pace somewhat below the estimated growth of the economy's potential. However, the expansion was expected to pick up later to a rate more in line with that potential. Subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. In addition, growth in private final demand would be restrained to some extent by the tighter terms and conditions that were now being imposed by many types of lenders, by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices, and by the buildup of stocks of consumer durables, housing units, and business capital goods. Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease slightly as the expansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the year ahead, largely in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that moderate growth at a pace close to the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation for the year ahead. The members recognized, however, that such a projection was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty in both directions. On the upside, they emphasized the marked resilience and persisting strength of private domestic demand, which had kept the economy expanding at a faster pace than most had anticipated. In addition, members commented that domestic financial conditions, including the rebound in stock market prices, currently were supportive of further expansion in aggregate demand, and in that regard several noted the continued rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregates. Still, domestic financial markets remained unusually sensitive and subject to relatively pronounced adjustments to unanticipated developments that could have substantial effects on confidence and economic activity. The external sector continued to represent a major source of downside risk; the economies of several industrial countries seemed to be weakening, and the outlook for several key emerging market economies remained in doubt, with a further loss of confidence and contagion from the latter a continuing threat. With regard to the outlook for inflation, members reported that labor markets were extraordinarily tight across the nation, but they saw only limited evidence of accelerating wage increases and little or no evidence of rising inflation in broad measures of prices. Several commented, however, that the risks of inflation appeared to be tilted to the upside, given the continuing strength of the domestic expansion and accommodative financial conditions.  In their review of developments in various parts of the country and major industries, members referred to widespread evidence of high levels and strong growth of overall domestic production and demand, but also to the continued retarding effects of the foreign trade sector on agriculture and manufacturing and extractive industries. Growth in consumer spending was expected to moderate over coming quarters from a very robust pace. Factors contributing to this assessment included expectations of somewhat slower growth in employment and incomes and the prospect that increases in financial wealth would moderate or even end at some point. Members also referred to the possibility that the very low saving rate would tend to limit increases in consumer spending, but they noted that high levels of consumer confidence and wealth along with low interest rates should help to sustain at least moderate growth in coming quarters.  Forecasts of business investment spending pointed to appreciable deceleration in the year ahead after very rapid increases in recent years. Among the factors cited in support of a slowing uptrend were the anticipated slower growth in overall demand and the large cumulative buildup of business capital that had resulted in comparatively subdued pressures on capacity. Forecasts of reduced growth in business expenditures tended to be supported by anecdotal reports that many business firms were planning to trim their capital outlays during the year ahead. Perhaps the slower growth in corporate earnings, which had been evident since earlier in the year, and reduced cash flows were beginning to exert some restraint on business capital spending. Some members observed, however, that there was little evidence thus far of any deceleration in business equipment expenditures and that the persistence of tight labor markets should continue to encourage relatively rapid growth in labor-saving business capital.  Housing activity had displayed a great deal of strength in recent months according to both anecdotal and statistical reports at this meeting. Comparatively warm weather had extended the building season in several areas, while rising incomes and low interest rates had continued to stimulate housing demand. Some retrenchment in housing activity from currently high levels seemed likely over coming quarters, given the recent large additions to the stock of housing units and some anticipated deceleration in the growth of jobs and incomes.  Members viewed the foreign sector as likely to exert a smaller negative effect on domestic growth in the year ahead. This view was based on the expectation of some stabilization or improvement in foreign financial markets and economies. In addition, the foreign exchange value of the dollar had been declining in recent months, and the effects of its earlier appreciation on the trade balance would be waning. However, they recognized that net exports could turn out to be substantially more negative than the modal forecast, given the persistence of very fragile financial and economic conditions in several large emerging economies, continued weakness in the Japanese economy, and questions about the prospective strength of economic activity in other industrial nations. As recent experience had demonstrated, a crisis in one or a group of important financial markets and economies could spread rapidly around the world.  The outlook for inflation remained favorable, though some members referred to a number of upside risks going forward. For now, however, there were few signs of rising price inflation despite widespread indications of very tight labor markets, including reports of further tightening in some areas. Indeed, the most recent wage and price data were encouraging. Increases in core measures of prices were limited and sizable declines in oil and commodity prices should help to moderate inflation going forward, in part by holding down inflation expectations. Looking beyond the nearer term, current forecasts suggested that moderating growth in overall economic activity would tend to limit pressures on resources and foster relatively subdued price inflation in the context of robust productivity growth and ample industrial capacity. Members who viewed the risks as tilted mainly to the upside commented that the effects of the anticipated reversal of a number of factors--including the declines in oil and commodity prices and restrained increases in health care costs--that had tended to hold down overall inflation might turn out to be more pronounced than was currently forecast. Moreover, underlying cost and price pressures might emerge more rapidly under such circumstances, especially if overall demand continued to outpace the growth of potential. Some members also referred to the potential inflationary effects over time of the continuation of quite rapid monetary growth. On balance, however, the members generally believed that prospective trends in overall economic activity and the persistence of strong competitive pressures in most markets, including the effects of foreign competition, were likely in the context of now firmly embedded expectations of low inflation to moderate any tendency for price inflation to accelerate over the year ahead.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining an unchanged policy stance. The System's policy easing actions since late September had helped to stabilize a dangerously eroding financial situation, and current financial conditions as well as underlying economic trends suggested that needed policy adjustments had been completed. For now at least, monetary policy appeared to be consistent with the Committee's objectives of fostering sustained low inflation and high employment. Accordingly, the Committee had entered a period where vigilance was called for but where the direction and timing of the next policy move were uncertain.  As already noted, Committee members saw risks on both sides of their forecasts. Persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures. But greater disturbances abroad, especially if they were to be transmitted to domestic financial markets, could exert considerable restraint on the domestic economy. Fortunately, with low inflation, if not price stability, increasingly embedded in expectations, the Committee would have time to react to potential inflationary pressures. In the event of downward shocks to the expansion, prompt action to ease policy would be needed, but such shocks could not be anticipated at this point. Against this background, all the members indicated that they were in favor of retaining the symmetry in the existing directive.  Prior to its vote on policy at this meeting, the Committee discussed the wording of the operating paragraph of the directive, building on progress made toward a consensus at previous meetings. Attention focused in part on proposed new wording to describe the possibility of intermeeting actions. There were minor differences about specific wording, but no strongly held opinions, and all the members agreed that the new wording preferred by a majority of the members represented an improvement over the traditional language in that it would communicate more clearly and succinctly the substance of the Committee's policy decisions. The Committee also discussed deleting the last sentence in the operating paragraph relating to the outlook for the growth of money; another paragraph in the directive would continue to report the long-run ranges for such growth that the Federal Reserve Act requires the Committee to establish. With regard to the proposed deletion, some felt it was desirable for the central bank to retain a reference to money in the operating paragraph; more members supported the deletion on the ground that, as had been explained to the Congress, money growth had not had any special significance for some time in the formulation of monetary policy owing to often unexplained and unexpected changes in velocity. The rewording of the sentence on symmetry and the deletion of the sentence on money were not intended to imply any change in policy or the Committee's approach to policy or its decisionmaking.  At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members supported a reworded directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent and did not contain any bias with respect to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.  The Committee then voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has continued to expand at a brisk pace in recent months. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment was strong in November, after more moderate gains in September and October, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent. Total industrial production declined somewhat in November, but manufacturing output was stable and up considerably from the third-quarter pace. Business inventory accumulation slowed appreciably in October after a sizable rise in the third quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in October from its third-quarter average. Total retail sales rose sharply in October and November, and housing starts were strong as well. Available indicators point to a considerable pickup in business capital spending after a lull in the third quarter. Trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months.  Most short-term interest rates have changed little on balance since the meeting on November 17, but longer- term rates have declined somewhat. Share prices in equity markets have remained volatile and have posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has declined slightly over the period in relation to other major currencies and in terms of an index of the currencies of other countries that are important trading partners of the United States.  M2 and M3 have posted very large increases in recent months. For the year through November, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent months at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting on June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.

A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded rapidly in the closing months of 1998. Widespread strength in domestic final demand and a diminished drag from net exports underpinned further solid gains in production, employment, and income. Inflation remained subdued despite very tight labor markets.  Nonfarm payroll employment recorded robust increases in November and December. Although manufacturing experienced further sizable job losses over the two months, strong employment gains were achieved in construction, retail trade, and the services industries. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in December, and other measures of labor conditions also indicated that labor markets remained quite tight through year-end.  Industrial production rebounded in December from a small November decline. Industrial output strengthened for the fourth quarter as a whole, largely reflecting a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts that more than offset sizable reductions in mining and utility output. The manufacture of high-tech equipment surged further and the production of construction supplies stayed on a brisk upward trend while activity in other manufacturing categories remained weak. On balance, output in manufacturing expanded at about the same pace as capacity, leaving the factory operating rate unchanged at a relatively low level.  Consumer spending, supported by further sizable gains in income and net worth, remained robust through year-end. Retail sales rose sharply in the fourth quarter. Expenditures for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles, were very strong. Outlays for nondurable goods were brisk despite sluggish growth in spending for apparel. Unseasonably mild weather held down spending for energy services in November and December, but purchases of other types of services recorded moderate increases. Surveys in early 1999 indicated buoyant consumer sentiment, reflecting optimism about personal finances and the employment outlook.  Residential housing activity continued to display substantial strength in the fourth quarter. Single-family housing starts remained at a very high level in December, and sales of new homes in that month were only slightly below the record established in November. Sales of existing homes hit a record high in December. Unseasonably favorable weather extended the construction season in some areas of the country, but low mortgage rates, rapid employment growth, rising net worth, and special financing programs designed to broaden opportunities for homeownership were important factors in the strength of home sales. Multifamily housing starts edged lower in the fourth quarter as a December increase partially reversed a November decline; rents have continued to rise in real terms over the last several years, but vacancy rates have changed little.  Business fixed investment picked up markedly in the fourth quarter after the small decline of the previous quarter. Much of the surge in spending on producers' durable equipment was attributable to a pickup in purchases of motor vehicles and aircraft. Elsewhere, investment in high-tech equipment expanded rapidly further, while spending for other types of durable equipment decelerated somewhat. Nonresidential construction activity apparently rose moderately in the fourth quarter. Office construction picked up further in an environment of falling vacancy rates and rising rental costs, but other building activity remained sluggish.  The pace of business inventory investment in October and November was slightly above that of the third quarter, but in comparison with strong sales inventory positions were relatively lean in most industries. In manufacturing, stocks increased moderately in the October-November period, and the aggregate stock-shipments ratio was in the middle of its narrow range for the past year. Inventory investment in the wholesale sector slowed considerably, but much of the swing reflected the unusually early harvest of farm products. The inventory-sales ratio for this sector was still at the top of its range for the last year, and inventory overhangs persisted in metals and minerals, machinery, and chemicals. Retailers stepped up their inventory accumulation in the October-November period. However, sales were robust and the inventory-sales ratio for this sector continued to trend downward.  The average deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services for October and November was a little smaller than the rate for the third quarter. The value of exports for the two-month period rose considerably, with the largest gains occurring in automotive products shipped to Canada, aircraft, machinery, agricultural products, and services. The value of imports also moved up, but by less than the value of exports. While the increases in imports were widespread across trade categories, particularly large advances were recorded for automotive products from Canada and Mexico and for computers. The available data suggested a weaker economic performance in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the fourth quarter; economic activity likely fell further in Japan, and economic growth apparently slowed in most countries of the euro bloc. Activity in most Asian developing countries remained depressed, though some seemed to be approaching a trough and Korea appeared to be in the early stages of a recovery. Moreover, economic conditions worsened in most Latin American economies.  Inflation remained low in 1998. Consumer prices changed little in December, reflecting a sizable drop in energy prices that offset the large increase in tobacco prices put in place after a settlement was reached between states and the tobacco makers. For 1998 as a whole, CPI inflation was slightly lower than in 1997; a substantial decline in energy prices more than offset a sizable pickup in food inflation and a small increase in core inflation. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged down in 1998 following an appreciable decline in 1997. While finished energy prices fell by more in 1998, finished food prices were down only slightly and prices of core finished goods turned up after having been unchanged in 1997. Growth of hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of 1998, and the increase in hourly compensation for the year was little changed from that of 1997.  At its meeting on December 22, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent and that did not contain any bias with regard to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. In the Committee's view, the stance of policy appeared to be consistent with its objectives of fostering sustained low inflation and high employment, and the risks to this outlook were reasonably well balanced over the near term.  Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at the Committee's desired level. In the event, however, the rate averaged a little below its intended level, largely reflecting the efforts of the Trading Desk to keep reserve pressures around year-end to a minimum. Other short-term market rates declined somewhat on balance, partly owing to the disappearance of year-end pressures. Most long-term interest rates changed little over the intermeeting period, but Treasury bond yields moved up slightly on balance, apparently in response to incoming data suggesting stronger-than-expected economic growth.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar appreciated slightly on balance over the period. A small decline in the dollar relative to other major currencies was more than offset by the dollar's appreciation in terms of the currencies of a broader group of countries that also are important trading partners of the United States. The dollar appreciated against the euro following the release of data confirming a slowdown of economic growth in much of the euro area and the absence of inflationary pressures, and it rose against the British pound after the Bank of England unexpectedly cut its repo rate. Moreover, the economic crisis in Brazil apparently contributed to an increase in the dollar relative to some emerging-market currencies. Against the yen, however, the dollar fell in early January to its lowest level in more than two years, evidently in response to sharp increases in yields on Japanese bonds, but the decline was partially reversed subsequently.  M2 and M3 continued to expand rapidly in December, with their liquid components, especially money market funds, registering particularly large increases. The effects of recent monetary policy easings in reducing the opportunity costs of these components, strong growth in GDP, and perhaps continued heightened demands for liquid and safe assets seemed to have contributed to this performance. Available data for January pointed to appreciable moderation in the growth of both aggregates. From the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, M2 and M3 rose at rates well above their annual ranges, while total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting pointed to a substantial moderation in the expansion to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's potential. Growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices and by slow growth of spending on consumer durables, housing units, and business capital goods after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items. Subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Pressures on labor resources were likely to remain near current levels and inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the projection horizon, largely as a result of an expected upturn in energy prices.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members referred to continuing indications of an exceptional economic performance that was characterized by the persistence of quite low inflation despite very high and rapidly rising levels of overall output and employment. The members currently saw few signs that the economic expansion had moderated to a more sustainable rate, but most continued to anticipate substantial slowing over the year ahead to a pace close to or somewhat above that of the economy's long-run potential. While many agreed that such an outlook was subject to greater upside risk than they had anticipated a few months ago--given the abatement of market turmoil and positive business and consumer sentiment---such factors as the waning effects of the earlier increases in stock market wealth on consumer spending and some slowing in the extraordinary growth in business expenditures for equipment were likely to exert a moderating effect on the expansion. Moreover, potentially greater weakness in foreign economies and possible disruption to foreign financial markets remained a downside risk to the outlook. Against this background, the members generally anticipated some pickup in inflation, though to a still relatively low rate, primarily as last year's declines in oil and other import prices were not repeated. A number referred, however, to the experience of recent years, which suggested that the inflation process was not well understood and that inflation forecasts were subject to a wide range of uncertainty.  In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1999. Their forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1999 had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3 percent and a full range of 2 to 3-1/2 percent. Such growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range centering on 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, implying little or no change from the current level. With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1999, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-3/4 to 5 percent. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/2 percent, somewhat above the outcome for 1998 when the rise in the index was held down by a marked decline in energy prices and reduced prices of non-oil imports.  In their review of developments across the nation, members reported a mix of high overall levels of economic activity in every region but softness in a number of specific business activities, notably those affected by foreign competition. In particular, many manufacturing firms along with businesses engaged in agriculture, mining, and energy were being adversely affected by weak demand in foreign markets, strong import competition, and depressed oil and other commodity prices in world markets. Foreign developments were seen as a continuing element of weakness for the U.S. economy and also as a major source of uncertainty in the outlook for the year ahead. In this regard many members referred in particular to the problems facing Brazil and the risk that further financial and economic instability in that nation would spread to other Latin American countries, with repercussions on the U.S. economy. Markets in the major trading nations around the world were likely to remain on the soft side, with Japan struggling to recover from its ongoing recession and economic growth in Europe showing signs of becoming more sluggish.  Robust domestic demand clearly had offset weakness in net exports by a large margin in 1998, and while the growth in such demand was projected to slow this year it was expected to remain sufficient to support appreciable further expansion in overall economic activity. Consumer spending had exhibited considerable vigor during the recent holiday season and anecdotal reports from several regions suggested that the momentum in such spending had carried into the opening weeks of this year. Further, though prospectively moderating, growth in jobs and incomes, supportive credit conditions, and upbeat consumer sentiment suggested that consumer expenditures were likely to be well maintained over coming quarters. Even so, members anticipated at least some moderation in the growth of consumption after an extended period of sizable accumulation of consumer durable goods. Among other factors, the positive effects on consumer spending of the large accumulation of stock market wealth in recent years were likely to abate over time in the absence of a further and unanticipated surge in stock market prices.  Growth in business capital spending also was expected to moderate as the year progressed to a pace well below that experienced in recent years. Members commented in this regard that slowing growth in overall spending normally fostered reduced capital investment, and indeed developments in the second half of 1998 suggested that such investment might already be on a less strong uptrend. Moreover, the prospects of reduced growth in profits and a less ebullient stock market could also be expected to damp business fixed investment. Nonetheless, growth in such investment likely would continue to exceed that of overall spending, reflecting ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and hold down labor costs in highly competitive markets and more generally to take advantage of the declining costs of business equipment and the rapid pace of technological innovation. Members also cited reports from contacts in various sectors of the economy and areas of the country that business plans continued to call for substantial outlays for business equipment. Nonresidential building activity remained robust in several regions, but given already ample capacity in many sectors, the prospects for such construction were relatively weak.  Housing activity had continued to display impressive strength in many parts of the country, evidently reflecting rapid growth in employment and incomes, rising household net worth, and low mortgage interest rates. With the affordability of new homes expected to remain unusually attractive, the members anticipated that housing activity would be sustained at a high level. Some moderation in housing starts from recent peak levels appeared likely, however, in the context of the slowing in job and income gains associated with the members' overall forecasts.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, the members saw no evidence of accelerating price inflation despite high levels of business activity and very tight labor markets across most of the nation. Indeed, the conjuncture over an extended period of strong economic growth, very low rates of unemployment, and the absence of any buildup of inflation could not be explained in terms of normal historical relationships. While temporary factors, such as declining oil prices, had played a role in depressing inflation, the persistence of very low inflation under these conditions most likely also resulted from more lasting changes in economic relationships. These were perhaps best evidenced by the widespread inability of business firms to raise prices because of strong competitive pressures in domestic and global markets and the related efforts to hold down costs, including labor costs. Contributing importantly to the success of those cost-saving efforts were the continued rapid growth of increasingly efficient business capital. The accumulation of such capital evidently had greatly enhanced productivity in a broad range of economic activities. In this regard, available indicators suggested that productivity gains had essentially matched increases in labor costs for nonfinancial corporations over the past year. Members also cited widespread expectations of low inflation as an important underlying factor in moderating wage and price increases.  Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation. The course of underlying inflation pressures was more difficult to gauge, however. If growth slowed to trend, as many expected, uncertainty about evolving relationships among economic activity, productivity growth, and wages made it unclear whether the enhanced competitiveness in many markets and greater cost reducing efforts of businesses would be sufficient to continue to hold price increases in check at the current degree of tautness in labor markets. Members generally agreed that if labor markets continued to tighten, cost and price pressures would begin to pick up. Some members also expressed concern that rapid money growth, should it persist, would suggest that monetary policy was too accommodative to contain inflation pressures. On balance, while a somewhat less favorable inflation performance was viewed as likely over the year ahead, the members did not anticipate any substantial deterioration in the inflation climate if growth in economic activity approximated the central tendency of their forecasts.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance. Many were concerned that the odds were tilted toward rising inflation over time, especially if the expansion did not slow to a more sustainable rate. Members commented that the market unsettlement that had in large measure prompted the Committee's easing actions during the fall had now lessened appreciably. In the view of some, those actions might need to be reversed, at least in part, to restore what they regarded as a policy stance that seemed most likely to prove consistent with desirable economic trends. Still, the persistence of subdued inflation and the absence of current evidence of accelerating inflation were seen as arguing against a policy tightening move at this point. Moreover, it was clear that the outlook for economic activity was subject to considerable uncertainty and that some shortfall from current forecasts, perhaps in conjunction with unexpectedly adverse trade and financial influences stemming from developments abroad, might materialize and damp inflationary demand pressures. Even in the absence of greater-than-anticipated slowing in the economic expansion, the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated that the relationship between demand pressures on resources and inflation was not following historical patterns, and developments exerting a more lasting moderating effect on inflation, such as more productive capital investment and effective access to spare capacity overseas, could help to contain inflation for some time. Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.  In light of the uncertainties and diversity of risks surrounding the economic outlook, most members were in favor of retaining the existing symmetry of the directive. In one view, however, the risks of rising inflation were strong enough to warrant consideration of an asymmetrical directive that was tilted toward restraint. Nonetheless, since inflation was difficult to predict and any needed adjustment to policy in the period ahead could readily be implemented even with a symmetrical directive, all the members indicated that they could accept such a directive.  At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy expanded rapidly in the closing months of 1998. Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in November and December, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in December. Total industrial production strengthened in the fourth quarter, owing in large measure to a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Total retail sales rose sharply in the fourth quarter, and home sales and housing starts increased appreciably. Available indicators suggest that business capital spending picked up markedly in the fourth quarter after a lull in the third. In November, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was somewhat larger than in October, but the combined October-November deficit was slightly smaller than its third-quarter average. Inflation has remained subdued despite very tight labor markets.  Most short-term interest rates have declined somewhat on balance since the meeting on December 22, while longer-term rates have changed little. Share prices in equity markets have posted further sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has depreciated slightly over the period in relation to other major currencies but it has appreciated somewhat in terms of the currencies of a broader group that also includes other important trading partners of the United States.  M2 and M3 continued to record very large increases in late 1998, but available data pointed to some moderation in January. From the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range in 1998.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.
